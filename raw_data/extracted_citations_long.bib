This article synthesizes knowledge on agency, capacity, and resilience across human development, well-being, and disasters literature to provide insights to support more integrated and human-centered approaches to understanding environmental change. It draws out the key areas of agreement across these diverse fields and identifies the main points of contestation and uncertainty. This highlights the need to consider subjective and relational factors in addition to objective measures of capacity and to view these as reflexive and dynamic, as well as differentiated socially and temporally. These findings can help distinguish between coping, adaptation, and transformation as responses to environmental and other stressors.},

Their lives are disfigured by ill health, poverty, lack of education, and underdevelopment. The universally accepted norm of sustainable development (SD) demands that the rest of the world, spearheaded by the rich nations, address the plight of the EP. In a welcome response, the United Nations (UN) has recently embraced the need for universal access to electricity and declared 2012 the “International Year of Sustainable Energy for All” with a focus on providing electricity. Although access to electricity must remain the ultimate objective, the daunting additional costs of electricity, and the time taken to do so—realistically 30 years—will shunt the EP into limbo unless interim measures are also taken. Beneficial energy based on appropriate sustainable energy technologies (ASETs) can provide such intermediate energy. ASETs bridge the gap between capital-intensive electricity and the traditional subsistence technologies of the EP. ASETs demand serious consideration.},

This review synthesizes existing knowledge on the occurrence, causes, and ecological impacts of forest transitions and examines the prospects and policy options for a global forest transition. The ecological quality of forest transitions depends on multiple factors, including the importance of natural forest regeneration versus plantations. Given an increased competition for productive land between different land uses, a global forest transition will require major technological and policy innovations to supply wood and agricultural products. In the globalization era, national strategies aimed at forest protection and sustainable use of forest resources may have unintended effects abroad owing to a displacement of land use across countries. Decisions by consumers combined with certification schemes and moratoriums have an increasing influence on the fate of forests.},

Using the literature, we identify seven generic policy-relevant principles for enhancing the resilience of desired ES in the face of disturbance and ongoing change in social-ecological systems (SES). These principles are (P1) maintain diversity and redundancy, (P2) manage connectivity, (P3) manage slow variables and feedbacks, (P4) foster an understanding of SES as complex adaptive systems (CAS), (P5) encourage learning and experimentation, (P6) broaden participation, and (P7) promote polycentric governance systems. We briefly define each principle, review how and when it enhances the resilience of ES, and conclude with major research gaps. In practice, the principles often co-occur and are highly interdependent. Key future needs are to better understand these interdependencies and to operationalize and apply the principles in different policy and management contexts.},

At its core, the PTD is based on the idea that certain natural resources cannot be fairly or effectively managed by private owners. Rather, these resources should be held in trust by government, which must manage their consumptive use and protection on behalf of present and future citizens. Although historically the PTD applied to a limited set of natural resources such as shellfish beds and submerged lands, courts and legal scholars have expanded the definition of trust resources to include wildlife, oceans, and ecosystem services generally. The wide range of interpretations of the PTD is seen as both a weakness (because it leads to uncertainty in property ownership) and a strength (because it can adapt to accommodate emerging science about what it takes to protect ecosystems).},

Increases in inclusive wealth indicate an improved productive base capable of supporting a higher standard of living in the future. To be truly inclusive, measures of inclusive wealth must include the value of all forms of capital that contribute to human well-being: human capital, manufactured capital, natural capital, and social capital. Sustainability concerns have increased attention on the ways of measuring the value of natural capital. We review various attempts to measure natural capital and to incorporate these into inclusive wealth including estimates using national wealth accounts and integrated ecological and economic models used to estimate ecosystem services. Empirically measuring the value of various types of capital in terms of a common metric is hugely challenging, and no current attempt to date can be said to be fully inclusive. Despite the empirical challenges, inclusive wealth provides a clear, coherent, and systematic framework for addressing sustainable development. Combining measures of semi-inclusive wealth that capture forms of capital that can be relatively easily measured in monetary terms with a set of biophysical metrics capturing important aspects of natural capital that are difficult to measure in monetary terms may provide a good set of signals of whether society is proceeding along a sustainable development trajectory.},

	abstract = {The idea of ‘sustainability’ received serious attention in the so-called Brundtland Commission Report that has many attractive features. In particular, it highlighted the importance of intergenerational justice while maintaining a concern for the poor of each generation and shifted the focus away from resources to human beings. I argue that this way of understanding sustainability, while a great improvement, is still incomplete. There are important grounds for favouring a freedom-oriented view, focusing on crucial freedoms that people have reason to value. Human freedoms include the fulfilment of needs, but also the liberty to define and pursue our own goals, objectives and commitments, no matter how they link with our own particular needs. Human beings are reflective creatures and are able to reason about and decide what they would like to happen, rather than being compellingly led by their own needs—biological or social. A fuller concept of sustainability has to aim at sustaining human freedoms, rather than only at our ability to fulfil our felt needs. Some empirical examples are given to illustrate the distinctive nature and the reasoned importance of seeing sustainability in terms of sustaining human freedoms and capabilities.},

	annote = {Sen argues that freedom likely has a role both in the specification of the ends of sustainability and in the identification of the means for achieving this, operating through values and institutions. 
He reviews some of the major contributions to sustainable development literature including the Brundtland Report which champions sustainable development and a Royal Society’s study which focuses on the strategic role of sustainable consumption. However, none of these sources examine the importance of a freedom-oriented approach.
The paper contrasts the freedom-based and need-based perspectives of sustainable development. People don’t simply act to fulfill their needs regardless of the consequences, as the needs-based approach seems to assume. It is important for them to maintain their ability to make choices in development programming. People can act as agents of change, informed about the issues that affect their lives, rather than simply consumers. Maintaining freedom can lead to democratic processes that encourage social change key to sustainable development. 
Clearly at the current historical moment, lack of scientific analysis is probably not the barrier to SD as much as getting citizens to be informed agitators. But what to do when citizens do not trust the knowledge and expertise they would need to be informed?
The article provides several empirical examples outlining how giving greater freedom to specific population can work towards the end of sustainable development. It mostly focuses on population growth.
 This links in with the Tellus institutes conclusions on transitions that it’s less about the science than the building of communities that demand sustainable development pathways and the linking of the local with the global.
It also to some extent links with Lukes/Gaventa but Gaventa outlines the major barriers to informed agitation when communities are held by all three faces of power.
Relevance to project: This paper very clearly is oriented towards empowerment and power through knowledge. Specially, Sen articulates how women’s empowerment can stunt population growth as they become more informed and employed. Sen also says that how the power of the individual can be heavily constrained by social climate (third dimensional approach). },
	annote = {This is a note about how this paper addresses Sen's larger theoretical concern of capabilities addressed in his book "Development as Freedom"
For Sen, the key issue is that because human beings are reflective, they should be able to "reason" about how they define SD and SD should be about sustaining the freedom (or capabilities) of people to pursue their own definition of sustainability rather than just about fulfilling their felt (biological) needs.
To solve SD challenges Sen argues "We need a vision of mankind not as patients whose interest have to be looked after, but as agents who can do effective things--both individually and jointly" (pg. 7).
Its not that we dont have to look at conflicts on the level of needs, but have to go beyond the role of humans as consumers with needs and consider their role as "agents of change who can--given the opportunity --think, assess, evaluate, resolve, inspire, agitate and through these means reshape the word"
Still, not totally clear what impact capabilities has on how we think about asset managment except that we should manage assets not just for basic needs, but for capabilities. This is what I have from Stiglitz, Sen, Fitoussi thus far... The goal they say is not just self-assessed wants, but capabilities. But what this means is that the assets that are about capabilities are esp important and interventions that expand capabilities (e.g. education) are as well. It was not a very clean answer so far.

To explore how these phenomena are linked, we apply a social-ecological systems perspective and review the literature to identify six different types of interactions (or “pathways”) between inequality and the biosphere. We find that most of the research so far has only considered one-directional effects of inequality on the biosphere, or vice versa. However, given the potential for complex dynamics between socioeconomic and environmental factors within social-ecological systems, we highlight examples from the literature that illustrate the importance of cross-scale interactions and feedback loops between inequality and the biosphere. This review draws on diverse disciplines to advance a systemic understanding of the linkages between inequality and the biosphere, specifically recognizing cross-scale feedbacks and the multidimensional nature of inequality.

We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System—biosphere, climate, and societies—and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

	abstract = {A growing field of sustainability science examines how environments are transformed through polycentric governance. However, many studies are only snapshot analyses of the initial design or the emergent structure of polycentric regimes. There is less systematic analysis of the longitudinal robustness of polycentric regimes. The problem of robustness is approached by focusing not only on the structure of a regime but also on its context and effectiveness. These dimensions are examined through a longitudinal analysis of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) governance regime, drawing on in-depth interviews and demographic, economic, and employment data, as well as organizational records and participant observation. Between 1975 and 2011, the GBR regime evolved into a robust polycentric structure as evident in an established set of multiactor, multilevel arrangements addressing marine, terrestrial, and global threats. However, from 2005 onward, multiscale drivers precipitated at least 10 types of regime change, ranging from contextual change that encouraged regime drift to deliberate changes that threatened regime conversion. More recently, regime realignment also has occurred in response to steering by international organizations and shocks such as the 2016 mass coral-bleaching event. The results show that structural density and stability in a governance regime can coexist with major changes in that regime's context and effectiveness. Clear analysis of the vulnerability of polycentric governance to both diminishing effectiveness and the masking effects of increasing complexity provides sustainability science and governance actors with a stronger basis to understand and respond to regime change.},

The potential for regime shifts and critical transitions in ecological and Earth systems, particularly in a changing climate, has received considerable attention. However, the possibility of interactions between such shifts is poorly understood. Rocha et al. used network analysis to explore whether critical transitions in ecosystems can be coupled with each other, even when far apart (see the Perspective by Scheffer and van Nes). They report different types of potential cascading effects, including domino effects and hidden feedbacks, that can be prevalent in different systems. Such cascading effects can couple the dynamics of regime shifts in distant places, which suggests that the interactions between transitions should be borne in mind in future forecasts.
Science, this issue p. 1379; see also p. 1357
Regime shifts are large, abrupt, and persistent critical transitions in the function and structure of ecosystems. Yet, it is unknown how these transitions will interact, whether the occurrence of one will increase the likelihood of another or simply correlate at distant places. We explored two types of cascading effects: Domino effects create one-way dependencies, whereas hidden feedbacks produce two-way interactions. We compare them with the control case of driver sharing, which can induce correlations. Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that 45\% of regime shift pairwise combinations present at least one plausible structural interdependence. The likelihood of cascading effects depends on cross-scale interactions but differs for each type. Management of regime shifts should account for potential connections.
Abrupt changes in ecosystems affect other ecosystems in time and space.

It is argued that theoretical frameworks and empirical analyses in transition studies lack precision when it comes to distinguishing between different types and levels of actors. In response, a Multi-actor Perspective (MaP) is developed, which distinguishes among four sectors (state, market, community, third sector), and between actors at different levels of aggregation: (1) sectors, (2) organizational actors, and (3) individual actors. The paper moves on to specify how the MaP contributes to understanding transition politics specifically in conceptualizing shifting power relations.

As R. Boyd and P. J. Richerson point out, “The enduring influence of Hardin's essay testifies to the power of a clear argument. Should a selfish herdsman add animals to his flock?”

PHOTO: ALECTRUSLER2015/SHUTTERSTOCK

“Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.” So argued ecologist Garrett Hardin in “[The Tragedy of the Commons][2]” in the 13 December 1968 issue of Science ([ 1 ][3]). Hardin questioned society's ability to manage shared resources and avoid an environmentally and socially calamitous free-for-all. In the 50 years since, the essay has influenced discussions ranging from climate change (see page [1217][4]) to evolution, from infectious disease to the internet, and has reached far beyond academic literature—but not without criticism. Considerable work, notably by Nobelist Elinor Ostrom ([ 2 ][5]), has challenged Hardin, particularly his emphasis on property rights and government regulatory leviathans as solutions. Instead, research has documented contexts, cases, and principles that reflect the ability of groups to collectively govern common resources. To mark this anniversary and celebrate the richness of research and practice around commons and cooperation, Science invited experts to share some contemporary views on such tragedies and how to avert them. — Brad Wible 

By Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson

The enduring influence of Hardin's essay testifies to the power of a clear argument. Should a selfish herdsman add animals to his flock? The benefit of additional animals flows to the herdsman, while the costs are spread among all who share the commons. Each herdsman decides to add animals, and the commons is over-grazed. Genes or ideas that encourage selflessness will be out-reproduced by those that encourage selfishness, so collective action problems can only be solved with coercive institutions such as police and courts.

This argument is clear and powerful, but wrong. Many village-scale human societies have organized hundreds of people to produce irrigation works and military action and solve commons problems, regulated not by formal coercive institutions but by informal, culturally evolved moral norms. Much evidence suggests that the propensity to be guided by culturally transmitted beliefs is a powerful adaptive tool that has been favored by natural selection ([ 3 ][6]). People in every human society acquire moral beliefs about what sorts of behaviors are right and wrong, and these beliefs can support solutions to collective action problems. For example, in the Turkana, an East African pastoral group, hundreds of warriors cooperate in cattle raids against other ethnic groups. The Turkana have no police, courts, or other formal coercive institutions, but cowards and deserters, tempted by selfish motives to free-ride, are punished by members of the community ([ 4 ][7]). Because norm violators suffer costs, those who adhere to the local norms do better than those who don't. Adherence to norms is self-interested, so genes and ideas that undermine successful norms do not spread.

This means that once they are established, very different norms can persist, even in similar environments. To understand why norms sometimes support collective action and sometimes don't, we need to understand the processes that shape norm content. Competition among culturally different groups is one such mechanism: Groups with norms that lead to economic success attract imitators, and norms that lead to military success spread through conquest ([ 5 ][8]). As societies become larger and more complex, political institutions play a major role in determining norm content and creating supporting formal institutions. However, there are many examples of norm shifts that cannot be explained as a consequence of group competition or deliberate political choices, such as the disappearance of norms supporting dueling in 19th-century Britain and shifts in norms regarding tobacco smoking, premarital sex, and same-sex marriage during the 20th century.

Although historians provide plausible narratives for particular norm shifts ([ 6 ][9]), plausible quantitative theory is scarce. Models based on drift-like random fluctuations make clear predictions but seem too slow to account for change in larger societies ([ 7 ][10]), whereas those based on self-reinforcing cascades ([ 8 ][11]) are fast but depend on an improbable balancing of processes. We think that developing such a theory is crucial for understanding human cooperation. Darwin argued in The Descent of Man that selection for cooperation in ancient tribes, acting over the long run, favored prosocial emotions such as sympathy and patriotism. These emotions, coupled with “approbation of our fellow men,” contributed to changes in norms, which in turn supported legal initiatives such as the end of slavery in the British Empire in 1833. We have argued for a modern version of his idea ([ 3 ][6], [ 5 ][8]).

When societies are small, and collective action problems are local, group beneficial norms often spread. The most difficult problems are those such as climate change that spill over into many different societies and require people from societies that share few norms or political institutions to create new norms. On the time scale of a century, progress in solving global commons problems has been impressive. It is not clear that for some problems we have another century to spare.

Water is a classic common pool resource: What one person consumes is not available for others, and water's mobility makes it costly to exclude other users. But classic studies of irrigation institutions ([ 9 ][12]) showing that people can and do cooperate to sustainably manage water have been instrumental in refuting the notion of an inevitable tragedy of the commons ([ 2 ][5]). Yet cooperation does not always emerge or survive, particularly in large irrigation systems built and managed by government agencies. Community organizers have been able to strengthen irrigation institutions, but this is generally time- and labor-intensive and difficult to scale up. Millions of dollars have been invested in large-scale programs to introduce, formalize, or strengthen water users' associations, but success in such programs has been limited ([ 10 ][13]). Groundwater is particularly problematic because it is a mostly invisible resource and it is difficult to understand the boundaries of the aquifers and how one person's use affects others.

What then can increase collective action over water? A strong tradition of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research brings together social sciences with irrigation engineering and hydrology, using case studies and comparative studies ([ 2 ][5], [ 10 ][13]). Elinor Ostrom identified design principles underlying effective governance of common resources: clearly defined boundaries, rules adapted to local needs, with users' participation and respected by outsiders, monitoring, graduated sanctions, dispute resolution, and nested layers of governance that fit the resource system ([ 2 ][5]). In addition to these, water scarcity, type of infrastructure, market integration, and social ties among users can all affect cooperation over water. For example, when many farmers in India get wells and no longer depend on surface irrigation for all their water, they stop contributing to the irrigation organizations. Or those at the head end of canals, who get water first, may take too much unless they also depend on the tail enders for other things, such as contributions to maintain the whole system.

Behavioral experiments, originally designed as games simulating commons dilemmas in the laboratories, have been adapted to be played with real commoners in the field. These games have shown the importance of communication, repeated interactions, information, and perceived fairness of the distribution of costs and benefits in influencing collective action. We are testing whether these games could be adapted from a research instrument to a tool that can also help water users understand the trade-offs and potential value of cooperation. In our groundwater game, players choose between crops with different water consumption and profitability and see the simulated effects on aquifer sustainability, showing that short-term profits by some come at long-term costs borne by all. In India, sites where this game was played were significantly more likely to adopt rules governing groundwater use, compared with control communities ([ 11 ][14]).

At a larger scale, multistakeholder participatory processes can sometimes create common understanding and consensus about opportunities for improving the complex governance of multiple water uses and users in river basins, including water quality improvement and reservoir reoperation for restoring more natural flow regimes in rivers ([ 12 ][15]). Ostrom's concepts of polycentric governance ([ 4 ][7]) and the rich literature on multistakeholder platforms and comanagement arrangements between the state and communities ([ 10 ][13]) provide insights—though not blueprints—for ways to better manage water commons in the future. Payment for environmental services financed by downstream users such as municipal water systems can encourage upstream conservation, such as seen in the Delaware County watershed that feeds New York City, but building trust between government agencies and different types of water users is key.

The practice of managing and using land and other natural resources in common—what the term “commons” originally referred to—has a long history. “Commoners” exercised rights to use resources over large expanses of permanently uncultivated, or only temporarily cultivated, open country such as heathland, rough pasture, or woodland. Commons were an essential component of early modern agriculture in many parts of Europe until the 19th century; their disappearance (through enclosures) was a key political issue at the time and has been the subject of considerable historiographical debate since. Historians, whose work on commons was for a long time mainly descriptive, have provided evidence that—contrary to Hardin's assumption—historical commons were dynamic institutions, with continuous rule-making, changing, intensive communication between the commoners and with effective monitoring mechanisms ([ 13 ][16]). Contrary to arguments in favor of their dissolution, common resources were used in an efficient manner, and improvements associated with enclosing common land and limiting access to commoners were probably not as large as originally thought by reformers ([ 14 ][17]).

A more analytic approach to commons' history, using archival records for many commons dating back to medieval times (in Europe), can provide insights about what makes a self-governing institution resilient for major crises and external shocks. After all, true resilience can take multiple generations and even centuries to surface. Historical sources are often still available, in the form of extensive written rulebooks, in many cases for commons with a lifetime of several hundreds of years during which rules changed frequently ([ 15 ][18], [ 16 ][19]). The reconstruction of these rules demonstrates that regulation often adapted to changing circumstances, and that survival over many centuries was not an exception, but the norm. Those rule books provide essentially the same type of data as collected through fieldwork by Ostrom and colleagues ([ 2 ][5]), but whereas Ostrom's list of design principles is the common denominator of a large set of commons studied at a specific moment in time, the historical data allow for a longitudinal study of the temporal dynamics of a common, of governance that needed to adapt or else collapse. An ongoing study of large datasets of 30 historical commons across the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom ([ 15 ][18]) is suggesting some ways in which Ostrom's list, and work building on it, may need to be updated. For example, sanctioning—in particular, graduated sanction, incrementally based on the repetition of violations—has been seen as an essential component to make self-governing commons work, yet graduated sanctioning is hardly ever found in commons surviving more than 200 years (the minimum years of survival as set in the study) ([ 17 ][20]). This suggests that in order to achieve long-term survival, this particular type of sanctioning may have been less essential than suggested in Ostrom's principles, and that those commons with graduated sanctioning in Ostrom's database may have been through a severe period, with many trials and errors of sanctioning, with the graduated version as the very last resort. Futhermore, analyzing rules and sanctions over the lifetime of several commons, there appears to be an inverse correlation between the effort put into developing sanctions (expressed as the number of rules accompanied by a sanction) and the longevity of a common (expressed as the number of years between emergence and dissolution), suggesting that commons that managed to survive longest invested least in designing and applying sanctions ([ 18 ][21]). This counterintuitive result may be explained by the longer-lasting commons investing more time and effort in (compulsory) commoners' meetings, leading to a more thorough understanding by commoners of why rules—and changes thereof—were necessary, and possibly, as a consequence, leading to less free-riding. Historical analysis can add unexpected insights to our understanding of which methods can be used to keep commons functioning in the long run, steering them away from a tragedy.

Over the past five decades, we have come to a deep understanding of commons problems and how to solve them: They are not zero-sum games, but instead offer substantial gains from cooperation. Game theory and market design have helped us understand how to provide appropriate incentives ([ 19 ][22]–[ 21 ][23]). For instance, taxes as well as cap-and-trade systems can be designed to make the price of emitting carbon include its ultimate social/climate cost, and subsidies can make the prices of alternative technologies reflect their ultimate social benefit. However, a challenge with global commons problems is that solving the incentive problems often leads the collective gains to be distributed very unevenly ([ 22 ][24]); the costs can even outweigh the benefits for some parties. There are many players with enormous differences in wealth and interests around the planet—both within and across countries—facing different consequences from commons problems and abilities to pay for them. Yet, universal cooperation is needed, including coordinated limits and the willingness and the ability to enforce those limits. Thus, the main challenges that we face are political. Crafting a policy that addresses everyone's needs becomes an even bigger challenge when combined with constantly changing political leadership with short-term perspectives and impatient citizens who make it difficult to incur large costs today for benefits that may not accrue for decades and involve considerable uncertainty and may affect others more than themselves. A natural reaction to this is to try to simplify things by concentrating on one issue at a time. Although this may seem sensible at first blush, the key to crafting policies that address a multitude of conflicting interests is actually to couple issues together ([ 23 ][25]). If there is an issue on which a group has little to gain and much to lose, then one gets their consent by including some other issue on which they have much to gain and little to lose. This is a principle underlying omnibus legislation: the packaging of unrelated issues into one large bill ([ 24 ][26]). Global organizations such as the United Nations have wide scope and can envision such compromise, but they are funded at a handful of billions of dollars when tens of trillions are at stake, and they lack full international buy-in and trust. The exception is the World Trade Organization (WTO); more than half of world gross domestic product crosses country borders. However, the WTO's scope is limited to trade agreements. In the absence of a world organization with sufficient jurisdiction and large enough carrots and sticks, there is a need for the leadership of key countries to step up and craft an omnibus agreement that couples commons problems with other issues, with something for everyone. Packaging issues produces an attractive agreement that entices participation, rather than coercing it by threatening nonparticipants with trade sanctions that may run afoul of existing treaties, fuel a trade war, or be costly to follow through with. Coupling global commons problems with other large issues will complicate our lives, but it is the only way to forge and enforce agreements at an appropriate scale, which everyone will sign onto. Without powerful international leadership, large global commons problems will continue to be ceded to humanitarian organizations and the voluntary behaviors of groups here and there.

Uncoordinated management of fishing, shipping, and seabed mining challenges the health, productivity, and resilience of the global ocean commons.

In many ways, the global ocean beyond national boundaries—twothirds of the ocean's surface—epitomises the tragedy of the commons. Access remains difficult to control, resources are declining, and pollution pervades the deepest abyss ([ 25 ][27]). Combined with ocean warming, deoxygenation, and acidification, these impacts undermine ocean health, productivity, and resilience, exacerbating the challenge of achieving equitable and sustainable management of our shared ocean ([ 26 ][28]).

Since Hardin in 1968, the concept of the global ocean commons has evolved. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) tempered the right of States to access resources of the high seas and international seabed (“the Area”) with obligations to build capacity, advance scientific knowledge, and protect the environment. UNCLOS further designated the Area and its mineral resources as the “common heritage of mankind” to be managed by the International Seabed Authority for “the benefit of mankind as a whole.” In the 1990s, States acknowledged that biodiversity loss and climate change were “common concerns” ([ 27 ][29]). More recently, concepts such as precaution, ecosystem-based approaches, and marine protected areas (MPAs) have been incorporated into international commitments ([ 27 ][29]), including United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 14.

However, global ocean health remains under threat because mechanisms to enable and enforce existing UNCLOS obligations remain weak ([ 25 ][27]). Despite new technologies to monitor activities and impacts ([ 28 ][30]), the current system of managing fishing, shipping, and seabed mining separately begets inconsistent, conflicting, and frequently unsustainable results ([ 25 ][27]). For example, illegal fishing is worse in some places than others; mineral exploration rights are being granted atop important fishing, scientific research, and cable sites; and biodiversity values are frequently ignored ([ 25 ][27]). Meanwhile, the lack of centralized reporting hinders efforts to hold accountable the few that block conservation measures despite treaty requirements ([ 27 ][29], [ 29 ][31]) and compelling evidence of need ([ 26 ][28]). In the Southern Ocean, for instance, compromises made to secure consensus for the Ross Sea MPA ([ 29 ][31]) highlighted the power of a very few states to weaken protections.

Conversely, on the rare occasions that the UN has called on sectoral bodies to implement specific requirements to tackle threats to biodiversity, substantial progress has been made. A 2006 UN resolution requiring states sponsoring bottom fishing to conduct prior assessments, adopt measures to avoid substantial impacts, and crucially, report to the UN has protected vast areas of the deep seabed. However, as ocean stressors multiply, the UN has recognized the need for a more comprehensive approach to biodiversity conservation and use ([ 25 ][27]).

In September, the UN convened the first intergovernmental conference to negotiate a legally binding agreement under UNCLOS for conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. The negotiations present an opportunity to elaborate and modernize existing requirements to conduct environmental impact assessments; proactively adopt conservation measures, including MPAs; avoid substantial harm to biodiversity; and improve accountability through regular reporting. The agreement can thus create rules, monitoring systems, and sanctioning powers to enhance compliance while ensuring more sustainable outcomes at the global, regional, and sectoral levels.

Science also has a major role to play as a catalyst for unifying stakeholders behind common concerns ([ 30 ][32]). The agreement can boost capacity and understanding by fostering collaboration in marine science, knowledge exchange, and technology transfer, including on marine genetic resources ([ 30 ][32]). The UN Decade of Ocean Science 2021–2030 could further facilitate knowledge advancement and collective capacity to enable informed, equitable, and sustainable management of our global ocean commons. The question is, will states adopt the mutual restraints and allocate the required resources to evade tragedy and renew ocean health? There is hope, but little time. An ambitious agreement is needed by 2020 to protect our common interest in a healthy, productive, and resilient ocean in the challenging decades to come.

Intellectual resources have their own tragedy-of-the-commons allegory. Replace Hardin's pasture with an idea, and consider what happens when the resource, the idea, is openly accessible to all. Everyone who can profitably make use of the idea will do so, as much and as often and in whatever manner suits them. But ideas are public goods, not common pool resources; ideas are not congested or depleted by overuse. Unlike the pasture, unconstrained consumption of ideas seems good, and often it is.

But there's a catch. Ideas are products of human intellect, often requiring investment of time, effort, and capital. Unconstrained consumption by free riders, who invest little or nothing in creating the ideas, presents a risk for those who might make such investments in creating knowledge because they may struggle to recover a sufficient return on their investment. Anticipating this, they may underinvest, contributing to tragic underproduction of intellectual resources.

Avoiding cultural, technological, and scientific stagnation thus seems to require collective action to ensure adequate investment in knowledge creation. To facilitate this, many analysts assume two options: government subsidies or intellectual property-enabled markets. Though both are indeed important drivers of knowledge production, so are “knowledge commons,” which we should not take for granted.

Knowledge commons refers to institutionalized community governance of the sharing and, in many cases, creation and curation of intellectual and cultural resources ([ 31 ][33]). Examples range from scientific research commons, including data, literature, and research materials ([ 32 ][34]), to intellectual property pools, entrepreneurial/user innovation commons, rare-disease clinical research consortia, open-source software projects, and Wikipedia ([ 31 ][33]). Understanding how such communities share and develop knowledge is crucial in today's “information society.”

Following Ostrom ([ 2 ][5], [ 33 ][35]) and Hess and Ostrom ([ 34 ][36]), we have worked to systematize the study of knowledge commons and build a new field of interdisciplinary research in which law, economics, sociology, political science, network science, and other fields converge. Dozens of case studies have begun to reveal an empirical picture of knowledge commons. A representative theme is that knowledge commons confront diverse social dilemmas not reducible to the simple free rider or tragic commons. Rare-disease research consortia, for example, address numerous governance challenges, including allocating research funding, authorship credit, and other rivalrous resources; overcoming potential anticommons dilemmas arising from researchers' incentives to hoard access to patients and their data; maintaining privacy, security, and the trust of patients and their families; reducing transaction costs of cooperation between widely dispersed researchers; and managing interactions with outsiders, such as pharmaceutical companies. The diversity of dilemmas is matched by the surprising diversity of participants critical to successful collaboration. Hardin's sheep-herder must be replaced with researchers, clinicians, patients, site coordinators, funders, third-party data custodians, and even government officials.

Despite growing evidence, we're still far from design principles, much less strong prescriptions. Yet social demand for trusted governance of shared knowledge resources, ranging from medical data ([ 35 ][37]) to algorithmically generated intelligence, is growing, even as public trust in governments and markets as sources of governance seems tenuous. Many researchers and policymakers understood the scope of Ostrom's commons-based framework as limited, for example, to small communities managing local resources. Now, more than ever, we need to explore if, when, and how commons governance can scale.

Antimicrobial use could be decreased if overuse led to loss of good reputation, and rules for prescribing established boundaries of “reputable” behaviors.

It has become commonplace ([ 36 ][38]–[ 38 ][39]) to refer to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a tragedy of the commons. Each individual wishes to use the common-pool resource of functioning antimicrobials whenever they might have a beneficial effect (whether in treating human illness or in raising livestock), but overuse accelerates the spread of drug-resistant pathogens, so the drugs become useless to all—and therein lies the tragedy. One way or another, some individual freedoms must be sacrificed in order to maintain a valuable resource for the common good. Whereas Hardin emphasized private or state ownership to achieve this, Ostrom argued that those who share in exploiting a common-pool resource can develop their own rules to prevent its overuse. She identified factors that are conducive to the establishment of effective institutions to regulate the exploitation of a resource: Users have common interests; they place a high value on the resource far into the future; users support effective monitoring; accurate information is valued and easily communicated; and it is feasible to establish binding and enforceable regulations. Ostrom warned that large groups often struggle to govern common pool resources and that boundary rules are needed to determine rights and responsibilities.

Many of Ostrom's observations are starting to be fulfilled in the search for solutions to the problems of AMR, even if few people in this area explicitly set out to apply her work. The growing threat of AMR is increasingly understood by medical professionals, policy professionals, and the public alike. The associated discourse reflects the common, long-term interests of these diverse users ([ 39 ][40]). The widely accepted need for better surveillance of AMR signals rising support for effective monitoring and accurate, shared information. In a growing search for effective rules, physicians are adhering more strictly to evidence-based guidance for diagnosing infections; for infection control in hospitals; for procuring, prescribing and dispensing antimicrobials; and for ensuring that patients complete treatments. Beyond codes of practice, governments have in some settings introduced methods of enforcement, such as restricting the use of essential drugs to certified treatment centres. And public health specialists have called for AMR to be included among the International Health Regulations, a legally binding agreement to prevent the international spread of disease. Last, the global nature of the challenge is acknowledged in the World Health Organization's leadership in developing new norms for using existing antimicrobials and investing in new ones ([ 40 ][41]).

Some other useful ideas arise when AMR is viewed as a tragedy of the commons. For example, a desire not to be seen as selfish offers a potential solution: antimicrobial use could be decreased if overuse led to loss of good reputation, and rules for appropriate prescribing helped establish boundaries of “reputable” behaviors ([ 41 ][42]). Further, the “large groups” problem may be less acute if local effects are strong enough that a region or nation can benefit from reducing their own usage, even if their neighbors do not ([ 42 ][43]).

In 1968, Hardin remarked that the tragedy of the commons was understood mostly as a set of special cases rather than as a general problem of resource management. The AMR tragedy will benefit from the application of the broad principles of governing a wide range of common pool resources. That will bring focus, for example, to the question of “boundary rules”. Can one country ever manage AMR alone, and can AMR for human infections be controlled without also controlling agricultural use? Also uncertain is the best mechanism of control: When are binding and enforceable regulations preferred over guidelines and codes of practice? How can the principles laid out by Hardin and Ostrom guide the creation of new resources (discovery of antimicrobials), besides conserving the ones we already have? In the face of these pressing questions, taking a broader view of the AMR tragedy, and of its resolution, will show how best to govern the antimicrobial commons.

	abstract = {The social-ecological system (SES) framework investigated in this special issue enables researchers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds working on different resource sectors in disparate geographic areas, biophysical conditions, and temporal domains to share a common vocabulary for the construction and testing of alternative theories and models that determine which influences on processes and outcomes are especially critical in specific empirical settings. We summarize changes that have been made to this framework and discuss a few remaining ambiguities in its formulation. Specifically, we offer a tentative rearrangement of the list of relevant attributes of governance systems and discuss other ways to make this framework applicable to policy settings beyond natural resource settings. The SES framework will continue to change as more researchers apply it to additional contexts; the main purpose of this article is to delineate the version that served as the basis for the theoretical innovations and empirical analyses detailed in other contributions to this special issue.},

"The IAD framework explicitly distinguishes three levels of analysis at which different types of choice processes take place: operational, collective, and constitutional. At the operational level, actors (either as individuals or as representatives of collective entities) make practical choices among their available options. Options are determined by both collective-level choices involving the determination of which strategies, norms, and rules are, should be, or are not available to actors fulfilling the specific roles defined by that group (as well as specifying who is assigned to fill these roles) and constitutional-level choices relating to who is or should be empowered to participate in the making of collective and operational-level decisions. The rules that define and constrain the operational activities of individual citizens and officials are established by previous or concurrent collective-choice processes, and the rules by which these rules themselves are subject to modification are determined through a process of constitutional choice. The critical insight behind this framework is that the outcomes of interactions in different levels of analysis are explicitly connected to each other."},

The proposed goals and targets can be seen as a network, in which links among goals exist through targets that refer to multiple goals. Using network analysis techniques, we show that some thematic areas covered by the SDGs are well connected with one another. Other parts of the network have weaker connections with the rest of the system. The SDGs as a whole are a more integrated system than the MDGs were, which may facilitate policy integration across sectors. However, many of the links among goals that have been documented in biophysical, economic and social dimensions are not explicitly reflected in the SDGs. Beyond the added visibility that the SDGs provide to links among thematic areas, attempts at policy integration across various areas will have to be based on studies of the biophysical, social and economic systems at appropriate scales.

An interesting finding* of the paper is that "Goal 12 (Ensuring Sustainable Production and Consumption) has the most network connections (14) to the other goals. This would be fairly intuitive in terms of the broad economic nexus of the goal but the linkages to the other environmentally-linked goals deserves attention. This goal is most directly linked to pollution externality concerns and the network analysis highlights how reaching the broadest range of development outcomes can have an impact on the environmental sustainability of production and consumption systems."

	abstract = {Countries regularly track gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator of their economic progress, but not wealth—Athe assets such as infrastructure, forests, minerals, and human capital that produce GDP. In contrast, corporations routinely report on both their income and assets to assess their economic health and prospects for the future. Wealth accounts allow countries to take stock of their assets to monitor the sustainability of development, an urgent concern today for all countries.

The Changing Wealth of Nations 2018: Building a Sustainable Future covers national wealth for 141 countries over 20 years (1995–2014) as the sum of produced capital, 19 types of natural capital, net foreign assets, and human capital overall as well as by gender and type of employment. Great progress has been made in estimating wealth since the fi rst volume, Where Is the Wealth of Nations? Measuring Capital for the 21st Century, was published in 2006. New data substantially improve estimates of natural capital, and, for the fi rst time, human capital is measured by using household surveys to estimate lifetime earnings.

The Changing Wealth of Nations 2018 begins with a review of global and regional trends in wealth over the past two decades and provides examples of how wealth accounts can be used for the analysis of development patterns. Several chapters discuss the new work on human capital and its application in development policy. The book then tackles elements of natural capital that are not yet fully incorporated in the wealth accounts: air pollution, marine fi sheries, and ecosystems.

This book targets policy makers but will engage anyone committed to building a sustainable future for the planet.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Gulf Coast provides a valuable setting to study deeply connected natural and human interactions and feedbacks that have led to a complex, interconnected coastal system. The physical landscape in the region has changed significantly due to broad-scale, long-term processes such as coastal subsidence and river sediment deposition as well as short-term episodic events such as hurricanes. Modifications from human activities, including building levees and canals and constructing buildings and roads, have left their own imprint on the natural landscape. This coupled natural-human coastal system and the individual aspects within it (physical, ecological, and human) are under increased pressure from accelerating environmental stressors such as sea level rise, intensifying hurricanes, and continued population increase with its accompanying coastal development. Promoting the resilience and maintaining the habitability of the Gulf Coast into the future will need improved understanding of the coupled natural-human coastal system, as well as effective sharing of this understanding in support of decision-making and policies.

Understanding the Long-term Evolution of the Coupled Natural-Human Coastal System presents a research agenda meant to enable a better understanding of the multiple and interconnected factors that influence long-term processes along the Gulf Coast. This report identifies scientific and technical gaps in understanding the interactions and feedbacks between human and natural processes, defines essential components of a research and development program in response to the identified gaps, and develops priorities for critical areas of research.},

But are we measuring, and thus managing, the right things–those that will help us solve the real social, economic, political, and environmental challenges of the twenty-first century? In Measuring Tomorrow, Eloi Laurent argues that we need to move away from narrowly useful metrics such as gross domestic product and instead use broader ones that aim at well-being, resilience, and sustainability. By doing so, countries will be able to shift their focus away from infinite and unrealistic growth and toward social justice and quality of life for their citizens. The time has come for these broader metrics to become more than just descriptive, Laurent argues; applied carefully by private and public decision makers, they can foster genuine progress. He begins by taking stock of the booming field of well-being and sustainability indicators, and explains the insights that the best of these can offer. He then shows how these indicators can be used to develop new policies, from the local to the global. An essential resource for scholars, students, and policymakers, Measuring Tomorrow covers all aspects of well-being–including health, education, and the environment–and incorporates a broad range of data and fascinating case studies from around the world: not just the United States and Europe but also China, Africa, the Middle East, and India."–},

	abstract = {Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science and R\&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames. Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative innovation policy should be a priority.},

Consumption is also at the heart of many of our most critical ecological, health, and social problems. What is referred to broadly as sustainable consumption has primarily focused on making consumption more efficient and gradually decoupling it from energy and resource use. We argue for the need to focus sustainable consumption initiatives on the key impact areas of consumption—transport, housing, energy use, and food—and at deeper levels of system change. To meet the scale of the sustainability challenges we face, interventions and policies must move from relative decoupling via technological improvements, to strategies to change the behavior of individual consumers, to broader initiatives to change systems of production and consumption. We seek to connect these emerging literatures on behavior change, structural interventions, and sustainability transitions to arrive at integrated frameworks for learning, iteration, and scaling of sustainability innovations. We sketch the outlines of research and practice that offer potentials for system changes for truly sustainable consumption.},

	abstract = {Existing technologies, institutions, and behavioral norms together act to constrain the rate and magnitude of carbon emissions reductions in the coming decades. The inertia of carbon emissions due to such mutually reinforcing physical, economic, and social constraints is referred to as carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in is a special case of path dependency, which is common in the evolution of complex systems. However, carbon lock-in is particularly prone to entrenchment given the large capital costs, long infrastructure lifetimes, and interrelationships between the socioeconomic and technical systems involved. Further, the urgency of efforts to avoid dangerous climate change exacerbates the liability of even small lock-in risks. Although carbon lock-in has been recognized for years, efforts to characterize the types and causes of carbon lock-in, or to quantitatively assess and evaluate its policy implications, have been limited and scattered across a number of different disciplines. This systematic review of the literature synthesizes what is known about the types and causes of carbon lock-in, including the scale, magnitude, and longevity of the effects, and policy implications. We identify three main types of carbon lock-in and describe how they coevolve: (a) infrastructural and technological, (b) institutional, and (c) behavioral. Although each type of lock-in has its own set of processes, all three are tightly intertwined and contribute to the inertia of carbon emissions. We outline the conditions, opportunities, and strategies for fostering transitions toward less-carbon-intensive emissions trajectories. We conclude by proposing a carbon lock-in research agenda that can help bridge the gaps between science, knowledge, and policy-making.},

In particular, this review points to the politics of alliance building and collective action for sustainability and development. Transformations cannot be managed or controlled, but must draw on an unruly politics, involving diverse knowledges and multiple actors. This review highlights how politics are articulated through regimes of truth, rule, and accumulation, and how understanding such political processes has implications for institutional and governance responses.

	abstract = {Clouded titles to land in remote rural areas of the Global South have recently prevented increases in agricultural productivity and payments for environmental services (PES), so making land tenure more secure has become a priority for policymakers. The historical dynamics surrounding land tenure transitions suggest a strategy for reform. Colonial regimes stripped indigenous peoples of most rights to land. Newly independent states restored these rights for some smallholders through land reforms. Later, neo-liberal regimes made secure titles more expensive, and, in so doing, made insecure land tenure more pervasive. Spots of secure land tenure did emerge when indigenous groups, with outside support, resisted efforts by powerful outsiders to expropriate indigenous homelands. Because insecure land tenure persists in most forested rural areas, a focus on afforestation in deforested areas, where earlier episodes of reform secured smallholder land tenure, offers a promising direction for future PES and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) efforts.},

In this review, we engage with some of the key design features, achievements, and challenges that situate and characterize the IPCC as an intergovernmental organization that is tasked with producing global environmental assessments (GEAs). These include the process of working through consensus to assess and summarize climate science and the need to include knowledge from as many of the 195 IPCC nation-states as possible, despite the structural inequalities between developed and developing countries. To highlight salient features that are unique to the IPCC but that offer lessons for other organizations that conduct GEAs, we include case studies on the politics of climate denialism, the use of geoengineering in mitigation scenarios, and the links between adaptive capacity, adaptation, and global development. We conclude with a discussion of institutional reflexivity. We consider how the IPCC can model an ethical and participatory response to climate change by critically examining, and being transparent about, the relation between science and politics.},

	abstract = {New partnerships between governments, private companies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are reshaping global environmental governance. In particular, there has been a rise of voluntary sustainability standards in an attempt to manage social and environmental impacts of global supply chains. We analyze the large spectrum of interactions between private, public, and civil society actors around voluntary sustainability standards, primarily for tropical agriculture and forestry. This review uncovers a policy ecosystem dominated by a proliferation of standards that complement, substitute, or compete against each other, with coordination mechanisms beginning to arise. Contrary to widely held views, interactions between governments, NGOs, and private companies surrounding the adoption of sustainable practices are not generally antagonistic, and public and private environmental governance regimes rarely operate independently. The influence of these interactions on the effectiveness of sustainability standards needs more attention. Better understanding how private regulations interact with the policy ecosystem will help design more effective interventions.

Four insights from contemporary SES literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c) systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored. Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.

They have become increasingly complex and interconnected with respect to the level (between local and global) at which they take place, the range of actors engaged in them, and the linkages between them and nominally nonenvironmental issues. Global environmental politics and governance have been rescaled vertically down toward provincial and municipal governments and up toward supranational regimes. They have also been rescaled horizontally across regional and sectoral organizations and networks and across new issues, such as development, security, and trade among others. This rescaling reflects shifts in the magnitude, complexity, and interconnectedness of the global environmental problems humans face as well as epistemological shifts in how humans understand and respond to these problems, and rescaling has implications for both the practice and study of global environmental politics.},

Research efforts have sought to identify, analyze, and understand the “green consumer.” Initial marketing and economics research, focusing on purchasing activities, has been complemented by research from fields such as industrial ecology and sociology, providing a more holistic picture of green consumption as a process. Much of the research has focused on areas with the greatest environmental impacts, namely peoples' homes and household management, their food choices and behaviors, and their transport behaviors for work, leisure, and travel. The emerging picture of green consumption is of a process that is strongly influenced by consumer values, norms, and habits, yet is highly complex, diverse, and context dependent. There are opportunities for future research that provides greater interdisciplinarity and challenges our assumptions and expectations about consumption and the nature of the consumer society.},

In particular, for ecosystems and socioeconomic systems, much interest is focused on broad scale features such as diversity and resiliency, while evolution operates most powerfully at the level of individual agents. Understanding the evolution and development of complex adaptive systems thus involves understanding how cooperation, coalitions and networks of interaction emerge from individual behaviors and feed back to influence those behaviors.

	abstract = {Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives—either economic or social norms, or both—can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.},

	abstract = {Abstract Decision-makers often seek to design policies that support sustainable development. Prospective evaluations of how effectively such policies are likely to meet sustainability goals have nonetheless remained challenging. Evaluating policies against sustainability goals can be facilitated through the inclusive wealth framework, which characterizes development in terms of the value to society of its underlying capital assets, and defines development to be potentially sustainable if that value does not decline over time. The inclusive wealth approach has been developed at a theoretical level and applied to retrospective evaluations. Here, we apply inclusive wealth theory to prospective policy evaluation coupled with dynamic simulation modeling, using a case of electricity infrastructure policies in oil-exporting countries. To demonstrate the prospective evaluation, we analyze investment policies in non-fossil electricity capacity in terms of their forecast impact on several dimensions of inclusive wealth. Illustrative results show that investing in non-fossil capacity in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait can increase components of the countries' inclusive wealth, though the impacts depend on future uncertainties. In contrast, comparable components of the UAE's net inclusive wealth decline under similar investment policies. Finally, including human capital improvements in estimates of inclusive wealth substantially increases its value, though the amount varies across the countries.},

	abstract = {The Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI) is a stock-based comprehensive indicator used to evaluate sustainability based on the wealth of nations, including a finer scale that considers the wealth of regions, in which these indicators are required for governance in the administrative regional hierarchies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. However, few studies have applied the measure to finer-scale wealth relative to the national level. In this paper, we fill the gap by examining the IWI in all prefectures in Japan, where sustainability is increasingly being lost as a result of depopulation, an aging population, and the excessive burden of environmental regulations. We determined that all regions in Japan maintained sustainability from 1991 to 2000. Then, regional sustainability was lost in 8 prefectures from 2001 to 2005 and in 28 prefectures from 2006 to 2010. This trend is consistent with those found in previous studies, though more severe. The decreasing wealth growth is caused by the increasing damage to health capital, mainly in rural areas, whereas produced capital has had positive effects but has not mitigated the damage. Finally, we illustrate how this index can be applied to evaluate projects in response to the intense debate in regional public policy for rural sustainability through a case study of seawalls as a recovery project in the wake of the Great East Japan earthquake.},

Experiments are underway with alternative metrics of well-being as ways of informing both research and policy. It is thus important to develop a theory of the production of human well-being to parallel theories of economic development and growth. The traditions of work in growth theory, sustainability theory, and household production functions provide the basis for an emerging structural human ecology of human well-being. Structural human ecology emphasizes the use of manufactured, natural, and human resources in producing well-being but is also attentive to the ways social structure shapes the production of well-being. While this approach is promising, several conceptual issues need to be addressed for it to realize its potential. In particular, we need greater clarity regarding measures of well-being and the ethical theory that underpins them and clearer thinking about the relationship between resources and capital.},

Also concludes that the two measures of well-being that are this point any good are life expectancy at birth (good data for the most part, is not influenced by a small group (e.g. with GDP but high inequality)) and subjective wellbeing measures. He lists a number of subjective well-being research papers and claims the field has improved (this measure can also not be influenced by a few super happy people). 
 
--- 
He claims this emerging approach is "structural human ecology" is this a framework we need to consider. So far it does not seem like a framework to me. 
---
Also interesting points on power (and citations): 



"Power can influence the return that comes from using resources by shaping culture and institutions to favor those with power over those without. In evolutionary terms, power reshapes the adaptive landscape. Thus power seems too complex and dynamic a factor in societal evolution to conceptualize simply as a resource or as capital."

In these articles Industrial Ecology was presented as an approach to understand and ultimately optimize the total material cycles of industrial processes (2).

This PNAS issue presents the second Special Feature on Industrial Ecology, offering the opportunity to reflect on the original goals and approaches and to compare them with Industrial Ecology’s achievements and its pertinent role within sustainability science.

The motivation to promote a new field as originally expressed in the contributions of the 1992 Special Feature is soberingly topical (3, 4): ( i ) the recognition that human alterations of the Earth System are progressing at an unprecedented pace; ( ii ) the insight that humankind has become a planetary force; and ( iii ) advocacy for a real-world sustainability transition that would be as fundamental as the industrial revolution of the 18th century.

Since the first Special Feature in 1992, the pace of growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, material use, and energy use has not slowed down or stopped, but rather has accelerated, especially after the year 2000 (5⇓–7). Human-induced alterations of the Earth System have reached such a scale (8, 9) that a new term for the current geological epoch, the Anthropocene, was proposed (10). Climate-sensitive tipping elements of the Earth System have been detected and described (11). Those tipping elements (such as the Indian monsoon, the Amazon rainforest, or the Greenland Ice Sheet) have been stable since the beginning of the Holocene but have the potential to irreversibly flip into fundamentally different regimes once triggered by a global mean temperature above certain thresholds. Some of those thresholds appear to be within the reach …

We show that chance alone will drive 1\% or less of the community to dominate 50\% of all resources in situations where gains and losses are multiplicative, as in returns on assets or growth rates of populations. Key mechanisms that counteract such hyperdominance include natural enemies in nature and wealth-equalizing institutions in society. However, historical research of European developments over the past millennium suggests that such institutions become ineffective in times of societal upscaling. A corollary is that in a globalizing world, wealth will inevitably be appropriated by a very small fraction of the population unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions emerge at the global level.},

Second, they show that a diverse set of countries are able to achieve high levels of human well-being while placing relatively little stress on the environment.

On the basis of optimistic assumptions, and implicitly assuming an indefinite continuation of potentially important pro-poor shifts in development policies during the baseline period, it finds that eradication will take at least 100 years at \$1.25-a-day, and 200 years at \$5-a-day. While this could in principle be brought forward by accelerating global growth, global carbon constraints raise serious doubts about the viability of this course, particularly as global GDP would need to exceed \$100,000 per capita at \$1.25-a-day, and \$1m per capita at \$5-a-day. The clear implication is that poverty eradication, even at \$1.25-a-day, and especially at a poverty line which better reflects the satisfaction of basic needs, can be reconciled with global carbon constraints only by a major increase in the share of the poorest in global economic growth, far beyond what can realistically be achieved by existing instruments of development policy – that is, by effective measures to reduce global inequality.},

Concurrently, the theory shows that by poverty we should mean a low level of wealth, not income, and that the distribution of well-being ought to be judged in terms of the distribution of wealth, not income or education or the many indicators that are currently in use. I show that the concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of assets and the idea of investment well beyond conventional usage. This perspective has radical implications for the way that national accounts are prepared and interpreted. I then sketch a recent publication that has put the theory to work by studying the composition of wealth accumulation in contemporary India.},

Systems linking people and nature, known as social-ecological systems, are increasingly understood as complex adaptive systems. Essential features of these complex adaptive systems - such as nonlinear feedbacks, strategic interactions, individual and spatial heterogeneity, and varying time scales - pose substantial challenges for modeling. However, ignoring these characteristics can distort our picture of how these systems work, causing policies to be less effective or even counterproductive. In this paper we present recent developments in modeling social-ecological systems, illustrate some of these challenges with examples related to coral reefs and grasslands, and identify the implications for economic and policy analysis.

First, the ‘reformist’ position, which focuses on firms pursuing green eco-innovations and consumers buying eco-efficient products, represents the political and academic orthodoxy. Second, the ‘revolutionary’ position, which is a radical critique of the mainstream, advocates the abolishment of capitalism, materialism, and consumerism, and promotes values such as frugality, sufficiency, and localism. We find this dichotomous debate problematic, because it is intellectually stifling and politically conservative (in its outcomes). To move beyond this dichotomy, we propose a third position, ‘reconfiguration’, which focuses on transitions in socio-technical systems and daily life practices and accommodates new conceptual frameworks. For each of the three positions, we discuss: (1) the scale and type of change, (2) views on consumption and production in exemplary approaches, (3) underlying theoretical, epistemological and normative orientations, (4) policy implications, and (5) critical appraisal. The conclusion compares the three positions, provides arguments for the fruitfulness of the reconfiguration-position and offers four critical reflections about future Sustainable Consumption and Production research agendas.},

My aim is to conceptualize power using social science theory and to demonstrate why and how the concept of power can complement resilience studies and other analyses of social-ecological interaction. Social power as a scientific concept refers to the ability to influence both conduct and context. These two dimensions of power (conduct and context) can be observed by differentiating between various sources of power, including, for example, technology or mental power. The relevance of the conceptualization of power presented here is illustrated with the example of fire as a source of social-ecological power. I conclude by discussing how attention to power can help to address issues of social justice and responsibility in social-ecological interactions.]},

	annote = {I liked how this paper drew on social theory in a much deeper way than any of the other papers on power in sustainability science, SES studies. It hit on the Lukes et al lit, but also on Weber, Latour, Giddens…
The paper was also at times disjointed which probably comes through in my notes on the paper.
The treatment of institutional theory was poor. The only time institutions were mentioned was in the box on “The Grapes of Wrath”. I think the theory development might have been improved by treating structure as institutions and looking the ability of actors to change institutions. They got around this however by talking about human power as both “conduct shaping” and “context shaping”. I took this to mean that conduct shaping was direct power over other others (human and non-human) and context shaping was the ability to influence institutions broadly defined as rules, norms, culture and beliefs. I think this fits into the three faces of power described by Luke’s, where the first face is more directly conduct shaping and the second two are context shaping.
One very useful insight I gained from the paper (though it was not explicitly articulated) is an interesting link between power as exercised through institutions and power as exercised through negotiation. This came out of Boonstra’s discussion: “These conditions include social structures (Merton 1938) and also social events, which refer to specific situated actions and interactions in time and place (Reed 2013).” Social structures constrain and shape human behavior over time whereas social events are distinct moments where a social interaction may have an unexpected outcome (one party may have superior negotiating skills for example). Critically the outcomes of social events can have future impacts I presume on both future actions of actors but maybe even on institutional structures. To link back to the three faces of power, social events and negotiation fit within the first face of power but social structure fits with the 2nd and 3rd That said there is a certain recursiveness to the situation because power structures set up in the 3rd face undermine the ability of less powerful actors to negotiate in the 1st face due to changes in understanding of self-efficacy.
Boonstra’s discussion of the relationship of structure and agency to power is cogent: “agency together with structures and events constitute social power: ‘Power structures [and events] enable and constrain human agency, just as the exercise of power by agents produce and reproduce power structures [and events]’ (Raik, et al. 2008:736)”. ‘Social power’ he argues is made up of both agent-centered and structural power.
In the discussion of the human use of fire as a type of power, the author includes a STS/Latour approach that brings non-humans as actors into discussions of power and social processes. I was unconvinced by how helpful this theoretical framing was to the rest of the work.
The empirical part of the paper is taken from Goudsblom’s work on how the acquisition of new sources of energy based on firepower transformed the ways in which people and nature interrelated. Goudsblom (2001) argues that “there seem to be two types of human behavior that are resilient: changes in behavior that generate and consolidate power (see also Giddens 1984), and behavior that adapts to this generation and consolidation of power (see also Scott 1985, 1990, 2009).”
Boonstra has an interesting conclusion on assigning responsibility for damage in social ecological interactions. In SES its often difficult to assign responsibility for negative outcomes to specific people because it often proved unfeasible to identify causal relations between individual actions and undesirable collective outcomes. But understanding the context shaping rather than explicitly conduct shaping side of power links people at more distant scales if not through direct liability though social connections to negative outcomes. Further incorporating the context shaping notion of power into SES studies helps to overcome the “vulnerability of a complex adaptive systems perspective, or any type of systems thinking” which “explains inequality, fairness, and unsustainability as systemic properties and mechanisms” (e.g. some humans are more responsible than others for the ecological degradation during the ‘anthropocene’.
Relevance to our work: I think it gives a useful way of thinking about negotiation theory as part of winning in the first face of power. But in these “event based” negotiations there are moments where longer-term institutional structures that shape other dimensions of power can be put in place. 
The reliance on historical examples lends further evidence to the need to approach the study of power from a longer perspective in order to understand its more complex dimensions. },

This article addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the potential of the concept of ‘roles’ from social interaction research. The role concept is operationalized for transition research to allow the analysis of (changing) roles and relations between actor roles as indicative of changes in the social fabric and shared values, norms and beliefs. It also allows considering the use of roles as a transition governance intervention. This includes creating new roles, breaking down or altering existing ones and explicitly negotiating or purposefully assigning roles, as well as the flexible use of roles as resources.},

	annote = {Wittmayer et al. describe how changes in role understandings in a community can indicate changing interactions and relations between actors within a community. Therefore, changes in roles can be indicative of changes in the broader social fabric. They can provide new opportunities for multi-actor collaboration to deal with societal challenges, like implementing sustainability practices, forming an important part of transitions. The article asks the following question: “What is the potential of the concept of roles for describing and understanding the interaction and relations of actors in sustainability transitions and their governance?”
 
The authors begin with a literature overview of transition research. They focus on the key points of convergence of  varying streams within this field and their treatment of actors and agency.  From their review of roles theories, they establish that the concept of roles allows for a more systematic description and analysis of the interaction and relations between actors, which can be made productive for analyzing current and historical transitions.
 
The article provides three main insights for transition research:

A single role always relates to one or more other roles and that a change in one has consequences for the others. This implies two distinct objects of analysis: the single role and a role constellation. The latter term refers to webs of roles, which interact, interrelate and co-evolve with one another. While an analysis of the single role provides insights into its substance, a focus on the role constellation highlights the relations between different roles.
In line with the focus of transition research on change, the authors suggest distinguishing between two temporal aspects of the analysis. Both single roles and role constellations can be analyzed either at a specific point in time as a temporary stabilization or over time focusing on how these change. 
The authors propose to consider the flexible use of roles as a particular form of transition governance intervention, suggesting that roles can be used not only explicitly, but also purposefully in interactions with other actors as acts of transition governance. It is through the creation and use of new roles or by breaking down and altering existing ones that role change prompts changes in collective processes and alters dominant institutional constellations. Therefore, we propose to consider the flexible use of roles as a particular form of transition governance intervention.

Wittmayer et al. illustrate their argument by introducing an ethnographic study in the neighbourhood of Rotterdam-Carnisse. They organized a transition management process of “problem framing, visioning and pathway development and facilitated actual experimentation” to institute alternative, sustainable ideas, practices and social relations in the neighborhood. Their case is based on interviews, participant observation, informal interactions on numerous occasions, document reviews, field-notes and the organisation and facilitation of seven deliberative meetings and six action-oriented meetings in the period from 2010 to 2015.   
 
Paper cites the Fischer and Newig paper AND BUT does a much better job on the topic of actors in sustainability transitions.  Its better theorized than the Fischer and Newig paper. While the paper does not explicitly link the concept of roles to a more theoretical discussion of the way agency embedded in different roles can change structure, the paper clearly wrestles with this anyway. 
 
Relevance to project: Roles, relations, and interactions, all have aspects of power. The paper talk a bit about constructing social roles that place the responsibility of implementing sustainable practices in the hands of citizens rather than institutions. In this context, it is up to the citizen to participate in their communities, actively working toward transitions. This relates to the relationship between power and empowerment. It also discusses the importance of accounting for the social construction of roles, i.e. the powerful vs. the powerless, in manufacturing transitions},

This book should be required reading for all sustainability scientists I feel. 
To test the three faces of power argument laid out in Lukes, 1974 (above) in a field setting using a historical approach he focuses on a coal mining town in Appalachia, Clear Fork Valley, between 1890 and the 1980s.
Gaventa argues that a historical approach to studying the three faces of power is the appropriate method to understand the mechanisms undergirding each face. In particular, it will help to overcome the methodological deficiencies of Dahl et al who focus on the first face of power. In contrast the historical method by allowing the researcher to study the mechanisms of power over time that lead to non-participation and non-action can get at the existence and mechanisms of the 2nd and 3rd faces of power. In addition, the moments of rebellion that did take place over the historical period studied and the quelling of collective action by elites lead further insights into the mechanisms of the 3 faces of power and the ways in which they are intertwined.
Rough summary of book: From my own perspective on the book, the first face of power (i.e. more resources to belonging to group A to control group B) seems to be a prerequisite for setting up the 2nd and 3rd In the case of the Clear Fork Valley, the powerful party (A) was the American Association Ltd—a group of British investors who quietly bought up land from the “mountain men” residents during the 1890s before they understood the value of the coal and other minerals underneath. The residents of the county and adjoining counties who worked for the mine slowly lost all of their economic autonomy as all land resources in the area belonged to the coal company. After establishing economic power over the miners by possessing more resources than the minors (in this case mostly natural capital), the coal company worked to both change institutions to further exclude the minors attempts to confront their oppressors. Using the first face of power (resources) they installed their own people in elected positions in the country. Then these people created rules that benefited the mine owners over the workers. They also refused to enforce other rules in law that would have benefited them—setting up the second face of power to benefit the mine owners. Finally, through media and company owned churches, the company used the 3rd face of power to create a culture and belief system that the inequities in the system were natural so workers would not see that they even had reason for grievances.
Through the chapters of the book one of the more interesting points that emerge is the interrelationship between the three faces of power. At one point when the actual power A has over B erodes due to macro-economic changes in the price of coal, the company is able to maintain control because the 2nd and 3rd face are still firmly entrenched in the region. Then when the price of coal goes back up, they reestablish the 1st face of power and then engage again in strengthening the 2nd and 3rd in a continual process. Later in the book the mineworkers strike and a consciousness emerges that the mineworkers have real grievances against the coal company that should be remedied. When this happens the 3rd face of power between the coal company and the mineworkers diminishes. In response, the coal company uses its 1st and 2nd faces of power to rebuild the 3rd face and maintain their position of power. Some of their responses include: manipulating local media, using law enforcement to keep union organizers out, creating fake news and alternative facts, using brute force violence, and using the church to breed distrust on the part of the minors in union values.
Some key points from the books conclusion:
“Once patterns of prevalence had been established within the decision-making arenas, power cold be wielded more readily over the decision-making agenda itself. Since the formative historical moment, conflict over matters of inequality has been contained primarily within the second and third dimensional arenas of power.” (pp. 253).
“the total impact of a power relationship is more than the sum of its parts. Power serves to create power. Powerlessness serves to re-enforce powerlessness. Power relationships, once established, are self-sustaining. Quiescence in the face of inequalities may be understood only in terms of inertia of the situation. For this reason, power in a given community can never be understood simply by observation at a given point in time. Historical investigation must occur to discover whether routines of non-conflict have been shaped, and, if so, how they are maintained.” (pp. 256).
“The dimensions of power say something not only about how quiescence is maintained, but also about the aspects of powerlessness which must be overcome to the development of successful protest”. (pp. 257).
This goes back to the model he presents at the beginning of the book.
Successful protest: 1. Issue and action formulation; 2. Mobilization, locate and overcome barriers to entry in decision making arenas. 3. Mobilize resources for a clearly conceived interest in an open arena.
“What for the powerless are obstacles to be overcome in the raising of issues, for the powerful are mechanisms for maintaining the status quo. Rebellion, to be successful, must both confront power and overcome the accumulated effects of powerlessness.” (pp. 258).
Another important issue raised in the conclusion are levels and social distance. It was even easier for the coal company headquartered in London to exploit the coalminers for generations because they were even more difficult to identify as the source of the coalminers problems.   
The final most general point made in the conclusion is that if democracy is not functioning at the local level in the US, then despite the fact that democracy at the national level seems to represent diverse interests, if the national level is built from local components that actual in sum represent the interests of the powerful than “democracy of the few will continue to be legitimated by a prevailing belief in the apathy of ignorance of the many”. (pp. 260).
“theorists and practitioners of democracy should turn their energies to considering how the power relationships of contemporary society are to be altered if the social and economic depravations of the people within it are to be overcome.” (pp. 261).
Relevance to our project: 
The basis of the 1st face of power is resources. In the book the main resource is natural capital (land and control over minerals) but there are other resources that undergird the 1st face including manufactured capital (the tools needed to exploit the coal) and knowledge capital (the knowledge that the land has value in the first place allowed the company to buy it at rock bottom prices from the more or less subsistence farmers who just felt they could move on to other land).
The 2nd and 3rd faces of power were derived from the 1st face as the coal company used their resources to create institutions which altered the social capital in the community constantly strengthening the social capital of the company and undermining the ability of the miners to build social capital.
I think that this very much supports the idea that a key root of power is ownership over resources. But this just gets at the first face. The 2nd and 3rd faces of power are more complicated and are produced by actors in the system through changes to rules and norms (face 2) and changes to culture and beliefs (face 3).}

All three are epistemologically rooted in an evolutionary understanding of socio-technical change. While these approaches are appropriate to understand market-driven processes of change, they may be deficient as analytical tools for exploring and designing processes of purposive societal transformation. In particular, we argue that the evolutionary mechanism of selection is the key to introducing the strong directionality required for purposive transformative change. In all three innovation theories, we find that the prime selection environment is constituted by the market and, thus, normative societal goals like sustainability are sidelined. Consequently, selection is depoliticised and neither strong directionality nor incumbent regime destabilisation are societally steered. Finally, we offer an analytical framework that builds upon a more political conception of selection and retention and calls for new political institutions to make normatively guided selections. Institutions for transformative innovation need to improve the capacities of complex societies to make binding decisions in politically contested fields.},

	abstract = {This paper presents insights and action proposals to better harness technological innovation for sustainable development. We begin with three key insights from scholarship and practice. First, technological innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions operating simultaneously from local to global scales. Barriers arise at all stages of innovation, from the invention of a technology through its selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Second, learning from past efforts to mobilize innovation for sustainable development can be greatly improved through structured cross-sectoral comparisons that recognize the socio-technical nature of innovation systems. Third, current institutions (rules, norms, and incentives) shaping technological innovation are often not aligned toward the goals of sustainable development because impoverished, marginalized, and unborn populations too often lack the economic and political power to shape innovation systems to meet their needs. However, these institutions can be reformed, and many actors have the power to do so through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and financing. We conclude with three practice-oriented recommendations to further realize the potential of innovation for sustainable development: (i) channels for regularized learning across domains of practice should be established; (ii) measures that systematically take into account the interests of underserved populations throughout the innovation process should be developed; and (iii) institutions should be reformed to reorient innovation systems toward sustainable development and ensure that all innovation stages and scales are considered at the outset.},

However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

A growing body of scholarship postulates specific attributes of boundary work that promote used and useful research. These propositions, however, are largely based on the experience of a few industrialized countries. We report here on an effort to evaluate their relevance for efforts to harness science in support of sustainability in the developing world. We carried out a multicountry comparative analysis of natural resource management programs conducted under the auspices of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. We discovered six distinctive kinds of boundary work contributing to the successes of those programs—a greater variety than has been documented in previous studies. We argue that these different kinds of boundary work can be understood as a dual response to the different uses for which the results of specific research programs are intended, and the different sources of knowledge drawn on by those programs. We show that these distinctive kinds of boundary work require distinctive strategies to organize them effectively. Especially important are arrangements regarding participation of stakeholders, accountability in governance, and the use of “boundary objects.” We conclude that improving the ability of research programs to produce useful knowledge for sustainable development will require both greater and differentiated support for multiple forms of boundary work.},

	abstract = {Agricultural expansion remains the most prominent proximate cause of tropical deforestation in Latin America, a region characterized by deforestation rates substantially above the world average and extremely high inequality. This paper deploys several multivariate statistical models to test whether different aspects of inequality, within a context of increasing agricultural productivity, promote agricultural expansion (Jevons paradox) or contraction (land-sparing) in 10 Latin American countries over 1990–2010. Here I show the existence of distinct patterns between the instantaneous and the overall (i.e., accounting for temporal lags) effect of increasing agricultural productivity, conditional on the degree of income, land, and wealth inequality. In a context of perfect equality, the instantaneous effect of increases in agricultural productivity is to promote agricultural expansion (Jevons paradox). When temporal lags are accounted for, agricultural productivity appears to be mainly land-sparing. Increases in the level of inequality, in all its forms, promote agricultural expansion, thus eroding the land-sparing effects of increasing productivity. The results also suggest that the instantaneous impact of inequality is larger than the overall effect (accounting for temporal lags) and that the effects of income inequality are stronger than those of land and wealth inequality, respectively. Reaping the benefits of increasing agricultural productivity, and achieving sustainable agricultural intensification in Latin America, requires policy interventions that specifically address inequality.},

We incorporate an estimate of resilience in IW by taking account of known or suspected thresholds that can lead to irreversible (or practically irreversible) changes in the productivity and value of assets and hence social welfare. These thresholds allow us to identify policies or projects that may be leading to an increased risk of decline in capital stocks (the wealth of the region). Such risks are not reflected through usual measures of current system performance, e.g. agricultural production. We use the Goulburn-Broken Catchment in south-eastern Australia as a case study to explore the significance and practicality of including resilience in inclusive wealth estimates.},

Economists have developed rigorous approaches to conceptualizing sustainability based on the paradigm of weak sustainability, which relies on extensive substitution among reproducible capital, renewable resources, and exhaustible natural resources. In contrast, strong sustainability emphasizes physical limits to this substitution and the importance of maintaining the resilience of normally functioning biophysical processes. Recent progress in resource and environmental economics has demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating strong sustainability features, including tipping points, uncertainties, and resilience, to assess efficiency and optimal policies. Given that weak sustainability and intertemporal efficiency share a welfare theoretic foundation, we ask: To what extent can these approaches be applied to evaluate sustainability? We highlight recent work on assessing sustainability in imperfect economies and dynamic models of intertemporal welfare that embed strong sustainability features.},

However, significant power imbalances can constrain the creation, adoption and implementation of socially and environmentally desirable policies. This study integrates theory on power with the institutional analysis and design (IAD) framework in order to provide a conceptual framework for examining power that is not captured through the IAD’s focus on action situations. We examined the use of collaboration in CPR governance contexts characterized by significant power imbalances. Two Canadian collaborative processes that involve large energy industry interests were studied. We assessed the ability of these collaborative processes to address social and environmental goals. Results revealed significant hidden power dynamics related to inaction and non-decisions. Collaboration was unable to produce progressive outcomes because of i) the restriction of the collaborative agenda by powerful actors; ii) selective enforcement of rules; and; iii) a broader neoliberal context that inherently favoured increasing resource extraction. These findings indicate that the achievement of progressive social and environmental outcomes through collaboration is constrained where powerful resource industries are present as participants.},

However, the world remains stuck with practices and modes of thinking that were developed in the Holocene – the epoch of around 12,000 years of unusual stability in the Earth system, toward the end of which modern institutions such as states and capitalist markets arose. These institutions persist despite their potentially catastrophic failure to respond to the challenges of the Anthropocene, foremost among them a rapidly changing climate and accelerating biodiversity loss. The pathological trajectories of these institutions need to be disrupted by advancing ecological reflexivity: the capacity of structures, systems, and sets of ideas to question their own core commitments, and if necessary change themselves, while listening and responding effectively to signals from the Earth system. This book envisages a world in which humans are no longer estranged from the Earth system but engage with it in a more productive relationship. We can still pursue democracy, social justice, and sustainability – but not as before. In future, all politics should be first and foremost a politics of the Anthropocene. The arguments are developed in the context of issues such as climate change, biodiversity, and global efforts to address sustainability.},

"The opposite of path dependency is reflexivity, the capacity of structures, systems, and ideas to question their own core commitments, and if necessary change themselves, not just do different things. The main requirement of governance in the Anthropocene is ecological reflexivity, which requires listening and responding effectively to signals from the Earth system, and foresight to anticipate potentially catastrophic changes. Ecological reflexivity fights pathological path dependencies. More effective deliberative and democratic practices can help. However, no fixed model of governance is appropriate in an ever-changing Earth system. Instead, this chapter shows how to think about building the capacity of governance to change, which is much more important than any specific model. The challenge is to develop governance capacities that have never been fully demonstrated before. },

	abstract = {This paper begins from the understanding that women's empowerment is about the process by which those who have been denied the ability to make strategic life choices acquire such an ability. A wide gap separates this processual understanding of empowerment from the more instrumentalist forms of advocacy which have required the measurement and quantification of empowerment. The ability to exercise choice incorporates three inter-related dimensions: resources (defined broadly to include not only access, but also future claims, to both material and human and social resources); agency (including processes of decision making, as well as less measurable manifestations of agency such as negotiation, deception and manipulation); and achievements (well-being outcomes). A number of studies of women's empowerment are analysed to make some important methodological points about the measurement of empowerment. The paper argues that these three dimensions of choice are indivisible in determining the meaning of an indicator and hence its validity as a measure of empowerment. The notion of choice is further qualified by referring to the conditions of choice, its content and consequences. These qualifications represent an attempt to incorporate the structural parameters of individual choice in the analysis of women's empowerment.},

We examine how and why elements of organizational design, objectives, and the evolving political landscape have interacted and changed, with a view of informing the design and conduct of future processes. We find that the historical genesis of GEAs is closely connected to the emergence of environmental multilateralism. However, the prevailing conditions and assumptions which originally gave rise to the GEA concept have changed significantly over time, giving rise to an increasing demand for a focus on response options and policies. We also find that the epistemic and process complexity of GEAs has increased substantially, without a corresponding expansion in the magnitude and composition of GEA management teams. We suggest that developing analytical capacities for policy assessment as well as ensuring sufficient resources and tools to manage increasingly complex GEAs is essential to ensure their future relevance and success.

Analysing the factors for these discrepancies requires multi-level approaches that relate policy decisions formulated at the national and international level with the decisions of local resource users. A key asset of the Institutional Analysis and Development framework is precisely its ability to link multiple governance levels. Yet most commons literature has been limited to the study of collective action among local communities without considering higher institutional and government levels. To overcome this limitation, I posit for a methodological development of the framework, which bridges the gap between institutional analysis, power-centred and historical approaches, and discourse analysis. The application of the extended framework to the study of state afforestation policies in Vietnam highlights the need to simultaneously consider institutions, the politico-economic context and discourses across governance and government levels. As illustrated in this paper, such a framework does not only facilitate the analysis of policy shortcomings but also supports the design and dissemination of policy recommendations.},

There is a feedback between these. But it flows through people who will shape the rules in use.
 
She does not say that the shapping of rules in use has to come through decisions of actors but my guess is that it does. In any one snapshot, you can of course relate the 3rd dimesnion to the design of the 2nd dimension, but it got like that because people did it.
Key quote:
 
"Discourses confer power to institutions by reinformcing or undermining their redibility. In return institutions influence discourses as the latter depend on the institutional practices in which they are embedded...
 
 
Another great quote
 
"Furthermore, the characteristcis of the resource considered (e.g. abudnace, size, sustractability and excludability) direcectly affect institutoonal perforamnce, independently of the inrepretation actors make of their environmenyt" This aspect, extensivly studies in commons theory has been omitted in most analyses of the power-centeredliterature.

	annote = {The paper describes the gap between policy intentions and outcomes. It emphasizes the need for multi-level approaches that relate policy decisions at national and international level with decisions of local resource users. Analyses of decentralized natural resource policies need to go beyond the understanding of how the decisions of local communities are affected by centrally designed policies. Exploring the gaps between rhetoric and outcomes requires considering the multiple governance tiers through which policies are negotiated and implemented. 
Clement postulates that the Institution Analysis and Development(IAD) framework (and typically commons literature in general) is good at linking multiple governance and can be used to remedy this issue. She advocates for the development of a framework that bridges the gap between “institutional analysis, power-centered and historical approaches, and discourse analysis”. And applies this extended IAD framework to afforestation policies in Vietnam.
The methodological development she proposes adds political-economic context and discourses to the original IAD framework. One of the core presumptions of institutional analysis is changing the rules-in-use can modify act behavior, and thereby incentives and constraints. However, it is necessary to change prevailing political-economic discourses to legitimate the rules. The examination of these discourses permits the analysis of how problems have been framed in the policy-making arena and facilitates understanding why current policies have emerged. 
This accounts for the linkages between local outcomes and the decisions of stakeholders at higher governance levels instead of merely marking the importance of local, contextual features that influence environmental practices.
Clement’s applies his framework to a state-led afforestation program, called the Five Million Hectare Reforestation Program, in the northern mountain region (NMR) of Vietnam. His data collection involved semi-structured interviews with farmers in three villages, local authorities and provincial authorities in four provinces, and central policy-makers including with about 150 respondents altogether.
Relevance to project: Discusses the importance of power in shaping institutional structure, which ultimately influence environmental policy and practice locally. In this sense, it is focused on power and inequality, allowing local populations to govern how they implement changes. It also summarizes the literature on the importance of local empowerment for sustainability and proposes strategies to better address empowerment capacities through institutions at the national level, which is central to understanding how to address it at the local level. },

From companies driven solely to maximize shareholder value to astronomically high prices of medicines justified through big pharma's 'value pricing', we misidentify taking with making, and have lost sight of what value really means. Once a central plank of economic thought, this concept of value--what it is, why it matters to us--is simply no longer discussed. Yet, argues Mariana Mazzucato in this penetrating and passionate new book, if we are to reform capitalism--radically to transform an increasingly sick system rather than continue feeding it--we urgently need to rethink where wealth comes from. Which activities create it, which extract it, which destroy it? Answers to these questions are key if we want to replace the current parasitic system with a type of capitalism that is more sustainable, more symbiotic - that works for us all.

They argue that power has two faces. This first is when A participates in the making of decisions that affect B. The second is when a person or group constructs or strengths barriers to public discussions of policy conflicts. They write: "A devotes his energies to creating or reinforcing social and political values and institutional practices that limit the scope of the political process to public consideration of only those issues which are comparatively innocuous to A. To the extent that A succeeds in doing this, B is prevented, for all practical purposes, from bringing to the fore any issues that might in their resolution be seriously detrimental to A’s set of preferences."
Mobilization of bias: Those with power institute values, beliefs, rituals, and institutional procedures, which they call rules of the game. These consistently and systematically function in a manner that benefit those in power at the expense of others. The beneficiaries have a advantageous position which allows them to safeguard and promote their interests. 
The ‘status quo defenders’ typically a minority. The elite do not necessarily guide the mobilization of bias: it often benefits the majority. 
They develop a typology of forms of control in both faces. This includes coercion, influence, authority, force and manipulation. 
Coercion: A maintains B’s compliance by the threat of deprivation where there is ‘a conflict over values or course of action between A and B’ (p. 24). 
Influence: A, ‘without resorting to either a tacit or an overt threat of severe deprivation, causes [B] to change his course of action’ (p. 30). 
Authority: ‘B complies because he recognizes that [A’s] command is reasonable in terms of his own values’ either because its content is legitimate or because it has been decided through a legitimate procedures (pp. 34, 37).
Force: A reaches her objectives in the face of B’s noncompliance by stripping him of the choice between compliance and noncompliance.
Manipulation: an ‘aspect’ or sub-concept of force, 'forthcoming in the absence of recognition on the complier’s part either of the source or the exact nature of the demand upon him’ (p. 28).
They criticize the pluralists one-dimensional view of power for being anti behavioural., meaning that it ‘unduly emphasizes the importance of initiating, deciding, and vetoing. This does not account for the fact that power is often exercise to minimize the the scope of decision-making to ‘‘safe’’ issues’ (p. 6). 
Two-dimensional power involves both decision-making and non decision-making processes, as opposed to one-dimensional power which only involves decision-making processes. Nondecision-making is ‘a means by which demands for change in the existing allocation of benefits and privileges in the community can be suffocated before they are even voiced; or kept covert; or killed before they gain access to the relevant decision-making arena; or, failing all these things, maimed or destroyed in the decision-implementing stage of the policy process’ (p. 44).
That discount that if no concrete action has occurred, then one has a ‘non-event’ incapable of empirical verification). Instead they claim that that nondecisions are themselves observable decisions. Thus, if B fails to act because he anticipates A’s reaction, A has still exercised power over B. Yet, the indecision may not be overt or have the purpose of excluding potential challengers. This unawareness ‘does not mean, however, that the dominant group will refrain from making nondecisions that protect or promote their dominance. Simply supporting the established political process tends to have this effect’ (p. 50). 
By including nondecision-making processes in their analysis the authors alter the definition of what counts as a political issue. For pluralists,  political issues can be observed by a significant segment of the political stratum (Dahl 1961: 92). The authors explain that it is crucial to also identify potential issues which non-decision-making prevents from coming to light. 
Both dimensions rely on actual, observable conflict. There must be some form of observable conflict because if not the presumption must be that there is consensus, in which case nondecision-making cannot exist. There is no manner to empirically access whether there is a latent conflict. 
They have a wider concept of ‘interests’ than the pluralists. The conflict that they deem necessary to identify nondecision is the conflict of interests.  If the disfavored persons and groups have grievances then a conflict of interest is observable. Thus, whereas pluralists considers only the interests of citizens within the political system, the authors also consider the interests of those who are partly or wholly excluded from the political system though their grievances. 
They include empirical studies in their book about community politic in Baltimore. For example, they describe the political exclusion of African Americans in the area and how this population maintained itself, garnering more political authority over time. his was mainly because of the changing ideology of race and poverty in the 1960s. }

From this definition is developed a statement of power comparability, or the relative degree of power held by two or more persons.

	annote = {In this essay Dahl develops a definition of power that is “rigorous enough to be used in systematic study of the important social phenomenon.”
Power is defined in terms of a relation between people. Relative power between people can thus be compared (e.g. ranking of power of US senators over legislation on foreign policy).
“My intuitive idea of power, then, is something like this: A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B would not otherwise do” (pp 202-203).
Dahl is humble in creating this definition. The definition Dahl articulates is useful for his project, but he also acknowledges that “we are not likely to produce—certainly not for some considerable time to come—anything like a single, consistent, coherent “Theory of Power” (pp. 202).
I don't totally understand why Dahl decides to not relate power to “cause” or causality. He cites Hume for this. I think he is trying to avoid a discussion of mechanisms of power especially when they go through institutional structures.
“Power is a relation… it is a relation among people.” Though he acknowledges that you could think of power relations between animate and inanimate objects but it would overcomplicate his theory. (Don't worry other literatures will get into this!).
“Let us call the objects in the relationship of power, actors. Actors may be individuals, groups, roles, officials, governments, nation-states, or other human aggregates.”
“The base of an actor’s power consists of all the resources—opportunities, acts, objects, etc.—that he can exploit in order to effect the behavior of another” (pp. 203).
Dahl looks at basis of power, but what he cites are mostly institutions at a single snapshot moment. There is no consideration of how these institutions came to be the way they are (e.g. presidents power comes through several institutions including patronage, constitutional veto, influence with electorate, charm…). Dahl calls this base of power “inert, passive.” He then looks at the means through which the president uses this passive power base including “threats, promises, vetoes, exercise of charm”. BUT critically the power of the president (for example) is a relationship between his power and the power of congress (actor B) to respond.
RELATIVE POWER: “The probability that the Senate will vote to increase taxes if the President makes a nationwide television appeal for a tax increase is 0.4. The probability that the Senate will vote to increase taxes if the President does not make such an appeal is 0.1.” (pp. 204).
Another move Dahl makes is requiring a connection between the two actors in a power relationship: “In looking for a flow of influence, control or power from A to a, one must always find out whether these is a connection or an opportunity for a connection, and if there is not, then one need proceed no further.”
It seems to me that this is also a drawback of his definition as it ignores larger relationships at longer distances where complex institutions link actors in power relationships who are perhaps relatively unknown to each other. For example, in Gaventa’s book (looked at below) the stockholders of the coal company in London probably do not really even understand the way the company and the institutions it has created over a long historical period are exploiting the people in Appalachia.
Dahl then defines power relations and the actions/threats necessary to turn potential power into actual influence over action mathematically. In words his final definition is “The power of an actor, A, would seem to be adequately defined by the measure M which is the difference in the probability of an event, given certain action by A, and the probability of the event given no such action by A.” The probability of the event under both circumstances is always relative to the power of the other actor(s) A is attempting to influence. “Because the power of any actor may be estimated in this way, at least in principle, then different actors can be ranked according to power, provided only that there exists a set of comparable subjects for the actors who are to be ranked.” (pp. 214).
Operationally Dahl concedes that “[i]n practice, the concept of power will have to be defined by operational criteria that will undoubtedly modify its pure meaning.”
He goes through a lot of examples to come up with a formal statement of power that includes relative power between actors in a comparable way across situations. After formalizing this process, he uses it to rank the relative power of US senators vis-à-vis specific topics based off of outcomes in rollcall votes.
Relevance to Project:
Mostly relevant in my view in conjunction with the other two faces of power as discussed by Lukes
What is interesting is it’s this domain of power I think where most negotiation and even game theory takes place. From my limited knowledge, both negotiations and game theory perspectives do not allow for the long-time periods necessary for powerful groups to change rules and norms and to change culture and beliefs (see further discussion of this in Lukes and Gaventa reviews).}

The implications of approaching explanations of land use using this binary are illustrated systematically, drawing from empirical research on smallholder land use in the southern Yucatán of Mexico, a development frontier and environmental conservation region. The land-use strategies of mixed subsistence-market smallholder cultivators are explored through agent, structure, and integrated agent-structure models addressing parcel allocations to a suite of regionally evolving and/or extant land uses.

He also reveals who has been helped the most by globalization, who has been held back, and what policies might tilt the balance toward economic justice. Global Inequality takes us back hundreds of years, and as far around the world as data allow, to show that inequality moves in cycles, fueled by war and disease, technological disruption, access to education, and redistribution. The recent surge of inequality in the West has been driven by the revolution in technology, just as the Industrial Revolution drove inequality 150 years ago. But even as inequality has soared within nations, it has fallen dramatically among nations, as middle-class incomes in China and India have drawn closer to the stagnating incomes of the middle classes in the developed world. A more open migration policy would reduce global inequality even further. Both American and Chinese inequality seem well entrenched and self-reproducing, though it is difficult to predict if current trends will be derailed by emerging plutocracy, populism, or war.

Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in 1780, these men created a potent innovation (Beckert calls it war capitalism, capitalism based on unrestrained actions of private individuals; the domination of masters over slaves, of colonial capitalists over indigenous inhabitants), and crucially affected the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia. We see how this thing called war capitalism shaped the rise of cotton, and then was used as a lever to transform the world. The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, farmers and merchants, workers and factory owners. In this as in so many other ways, Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the modern world.

We reviewed 386 journal articles on transition management and sustainability transitions listed in Scopus from 1995 to 2014. We investigate the thesis that actors have been neglected in this literature in favor of more abstract system concepts. Results show that this thesis cannot be confirmed on a general level. Rather, we find a variety of different approaches, depending on the systemic level, for clustering actors and agency as niche, regime, and landscape actors; the societal realm; different levels of governance; and intermediaries. We also differentiate between supporting and opposing actors. We find that actor roles in transitions are erratic, since their roles can change over the course of time, and that actors can belong to different categories. We conclude by providing recommendations for a comprehensive typology of actors in sustainability transitions.},

	annote = {The paper is a useful overview of what is going on in the sustainability transitions literature in conceptualizing actors and agency (and to some extent but not really power). That said, it’s not a very strong paper. The quantitative text analysis should have been used only to motivate the paper and not to draw any type of conclusion as it’s not a topic that is particularly amenable to simple computer driven text analysis when what really matters is what the sentences conceptualize as a whole and not the number of times a particular word (e.g. actors, structure, agency, networks) was used.  If a paper uses both actors and structure many times, but offers no clarity on the relationship between actors and structure, then it’s not particularly useful. A better paper might have motivated with the overall rise in both systems based and actor-based language in the literature, but then gone on to do a more nuanced literature review of how these two ideas speak to each other across a subset of these papers. 
The paper would have been stronger if they more clearly thought though the relationships between structure, agency, the roles of individuals and groups as actors and POWER. Currently, there is no clear theorizing on the topic of power (no definition, or relationship between actors and power). The term power is raised 9 times, but always as examples from other papers and no synthesis comes at the end either. 
The theoretical concern with structure and agency goes back to the infancy of social theory. I think that they should have been able to provide more of a systematic perspective on how they were thinking in the broadest brush strokes of how structure and agency interact. I think we do a better job of this in the “actors” section of the PNAS paper, though more space would allow for greater clarity. 
The most nuanced section of the paper comes when they look at the "functions” and “dependencies” of actors in sustainability transitions. They conclude that “functions” (if I understand correctly) are the roles of actors and these functions
often change over the course of a sustainability transition (i.e. oil companies becoming energy companies and moving towards clean energy).  This is no doubt a true insight, but I am not sure that its particularly groundbreaking. The dependencies section also highlights the importance of coalitions of actors and networks in achieving sustainability transitions. They don’t use the word polycentric, but this is what they are getting at I think. This section also rings true, but is not particularly groundbreaking as a “finding”. They would have done better to highlight the implications for sustainability transitions scholarship and policy of understanding the polycentric nature of the process. 
They conclude that “we propose to consider changing actos’ roles (functions, dependencies, etc.) in a comprehensive actor typology for transitions”.  What I think they mean by that, is that the relationship between the structural elements of sustainability transitions and the functions of different actors and networks of actors needs to be better theorized. I agree with them if this is what they meant. Though I am not sure a typology is what is needed. Maybe more a model that leaves things at a level of generalization that does not require lists of actor types as this seems a big bogged down in the weeds to be useful.
In conclusion, a more useful treatment of the topic of actors/agency and power, would take a systems perspective that helps readers understand the mechanisms through which actors can influence sustainable development or a sustainability transition in different frameworks whether that is the capital assets framework or the MLP framework or several more. Clearly drawing more on the relationship between actors, resources and power would be useful as would a clearer review of structure/agency discussion.},

1. Inequality is driven by powerful actors setting rules in US much more than by technological change
2. Money and power are self enforcing... wealth begets power and power begets wealth
 
"American inequality didn’t just happen. It was created. …The forces that have been at play in creating these outcomes are self-reinforcing. By understanding the origins of inequality, we can better grasp the costs and benefits of reducing it. The simple thesis of this chapter is that even though market forces help shape the degree of inequality, government policies shape those market forces. Much of the inequality that exists today is a result of government policy, both what the government does, and what it does not do." (page 28)
 

emphasis on the ways that Governments encourage, permit, and decline to limit or tax, “rent-seeking income.”
Rent-seeking income provides a much higher ROI  income from wages or the production of goods and services. This is because its taxed very differnetly than wages or manifactured goods. 

 
Our hypothesis is that market forces are real, but that they are shaped by political processes. Markets are shaped by laws, regulations, and institutions. Every law, every regulation, every institutional arrangement has distributive consequences—and the way we have been shaping America’s market economy works to the advantage of those at the top and to the disadvantage of the rest. (page 52)
 
…Imagine, for a moment, what the world would be like if there was free mobility of labour, but no mobility of capital. Countries would compete to attract workers. They would promise good schools and a good environment, as well as low taxes on workers. This could be financed by high taxes on capital. But that’s not the world we live in, and that’s partly because the 1 percent doesn’t want it to be that way. (page 61)
In the thirty years prior to the publication of his book, the percentage of U.S. wage earners belonging to a labour union dropped by 40\%, from 20.1\% overall to 11.9\%.
"The more divided a society becomes in terms of wealth, the more reluctant the wealthy are to spend money on common needs. The rich don’t need to rely on government for parks or education or medical care or personal security. They can buy all these things for themselves." page 93
Negative Impacts of Inequality
1.Worker pschychology
2. Consumerism and trying to be like the top 1\% or the top 0.01\% -- "not just an individals absiolute income, but his income relative to that of others" (104)
3. Endangers the foundations of democracy... "…a process of disempowerment, disillusionment, and disenfranchisement that produces low voter turnout, a system in which electoral success requires heavy investments, and in which those with money have made political investments that have reaped large rewards—often greater than the returns they have reaped on their other investments. " ... leads to decrease in public trust....
 
Growing inequality, combined with a flawed system of campaign finance, risks turning America’s legal system into a travesty of justice. Some may still call it the “rule of law,” but in today’s America the proud claim of “justice for all” is being replaced by the more modest claim of “justice for those who can afford it.” And the number of people who can afford it is rapidly diminishing" (page 206)
"There is an alternative set of policies and institutional arrangements that holds out the promise of not only better and more stable growth, but also of a more equitable sharing of the benefits of that growth." (p 240)

From the biology of the deep ocean to the chemistry of the stratosphere, and almost everywhere in between, human actions have led to ecological alterations great and small. While our species has exerted environmental impacts, occasionally substantial ones since the Paleolithic, never before has humankind had such an impact on the Earth. A massive uncontrolled experiment is underway. Where it might lead, no one can yet say. The reasons behind this environmental tumult are sometimes obvious and sometimes obscure. This book highlights the role of the modern energy system and the economic growth it has fostered, but pays heed as well to population growth, urbanization, migration, the Cold War, and environmentalisms, among other trends and phenomena that affected the global environment. The pace of indicators such as energy use, population growth, species extinctions, fresh water use, carbon dioxide emissions, and many more has led some students of environmental change to label the period after 1950 as The Great Acceleration. This book argues that concept is valid. In addition, it argues that the scale and scope of environmental change have altered basic biogeochemical cycles to the point where the Earth has entered a new period in its history: the Anthropocene. Humankind, too, has entered a new age in which it rivals natural forces in shaping the Earth, its biota, its climate, and its prospects."--Provided by publisher.},

Under foundational, we address the need for co-operation with end users of decision-support resources, the contribution these resources can make to the formation of thriving communities of practice, and the match between the different types of decision support and user needs. Under design and construction, we point to the risk that policy settings will change over the multiple years required to build and publish complex decision-support resources, reducing the relevance of the final product. We discuss the need for innovative approaches to ensure visibility, credibility and hence uptake. Developers should be mindful of the requirements, resources and capabilities of potential users at all points in the design and build. We also suggest that decision-support resources may be transferable between sectors and locations, but the motivation should be around achieving excellence, and not just cost savings. Under supporting sustainability in the long term, we stress the need for evaluation and comparative studies of performance, leading to carefully documented updating and improvement of decision-support resources. Finally, in the conclusions, we look to the future. Can decision-support resources evolve successfully to meet the information and guidance requirements of the increasingly sophisticated adaptation practitioner community?},

Critically, the relationship between empathy and sustainability is mediated by place and identity that constrain and shape empathy’s role in pro-environmental sustainability behaviour.

Two key mechanisms are introduced and elaborated: the generation of resources in multi-locational subsystems and the establishment of structural couplings among them in a global innovation system (GIS). Based on this conceptualization, we introduce a typology of four generic GIS configurations, building on the innovation mode and valuation system in different industry types. The analytical framework is illustrated with insights from four emerging clean-tech industries. We state that a comprehensive GIS perspective is instrumental for developing a more explanatory stance in the innovation system literature and developing policy interventions that reflect the increasing spatial complexity in the innovation process.},

However, despite the proliferation of forest certification over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness. Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia), we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence of air pollution by 31\%. It had no statistically significant impacts on fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4 km2 on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood dependence (by 33\%), respiratory infections (by 32\%) and malnutrition (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations of a potentially critical conservation policy.},

Despite their promise, there have been few opportunities to rigorously quantify the ability of these nonstate, market-driven (NSMD) governance regimes to deliver conservation outcomes. This study analyzes the impacts of three NSMD governance systems that sought to end the conversion of natural forests to plantations in Chile at the start of the 21st century. Using a multilevel, panel dataset of land use changes in Chile, we identify the impact of participation within each of the governance regimes by implementing a series of matched difference-in-differences analyses. Taking advantage of the mosaic of different NSMD regimes adopted in Chile, we explore the relative effectiveness of different policies. NSMD governance regimes reduced deforestation on participating properties by 2–23\%. The NSMD governance regimes we studied included collaborative and confrontational strategies between environmental and industry stakeholders. We find that the more collaborative governance systems studied achieved better environmental performance than more confrontational approaches. Whereas many government conservation programs have targeted regions with little likelihood of conversion, we demonstrate that NSMD governance has the potential to alter behavior on high-deforestation properties.},

In the light of the estimated importance of social trust as a component of wealth and well-being, the paper concludes with some policy options for how social trust might be better built and sustained.},

	abstract = {With a range of potential pathways to a sustainable future compatible with the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C target, scenario analysis has emerged as a key tool in studies of climate change mitigation and adaptation. A wide range of alternative scenarios have been created, and core amongst these are five socio-economic scenarios (Shared Socio-economic Pathways or SSPs) and four emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs). Whilst mitigation scenarios (the Shared Policy Assumptions, or SPAs) have been developed for each SSP-RCP combination, describing the actions necessary to match the climate pathway of the RCP, there has not yet been a systematic approach to address whether and how these actions can be enabled in practice. We present a novel and transferable framework to understand society’s capacity to achieve the 1.5 °C target, based on four participatory case studies using the SSP-RCP scenarios. The methodology builds on a framework for categorising different types of societal capitals and capacities and assessing their impact on the potential to implement different types of mitigation actions. All four case studies show that SSP1 has the highest potential to reach the target. Although environmental awareness is high in both SSP1 and SSP4, continued social inequalities in SSP4 restrict society’s capacity to transform, despite economic growth. In the two least environmentally-aware SSPs, SSP3 and SSP5, the transformation potential is low, but the view on capitals and capacities nonetheless helps identify opportunities for actors to develop and implement mitigation actions. The study highlights that techno-economic assessments of climate strategies need to be complemented by consideration of the critical role played by social and human capital, and by societal capacity to mobilise and create these capitals despite different socio-economic trends. These capitals and capacities are essential to enable the rapid innovation, behavioural change and international co-ordination needed to achieve the 1.5 °C target.},

Here is a quite extraordinary new article that links up a bunch of our concerns in novel (at least for me) ways, and coming from a very interesting set of sources.  See the quote below; the full paper is in Zotero….
“Societal transformations are ultimately driven by different actors –both individuals or organisations representing different societal spheres
(governments, communities, market and third sector) – who consciously or unconsciously act to change the state of human and natural
systems (O’Brien, 2015, 2016; Avelino and Wittmayer, 2016). As these actors are embedded within societal structures (e.g. formal and informal
institutions, social networks, resource distribution), their capacities are manifest in the extent to which they are able to mobilise, create and change these structures (Giddens, 1979; Giddens, 1986) – in terms of institutions, resources, networks etc. We therefore base our methodology on assessing two key sets of indicators:
1 Stocks of five types of capital: human, social, natural, manufactured and financial, with a focus on human and social capital because they underpin the potential for transformational societal change;
2 Four types of capacity that give actors the agency to mobilise, create and change the stocks of these five capitals: stewarding, unlocking, transforming, orchestrating.”
 
It would be great if you could give me your thoughts at some point on where the “capacity” arguments that are here associated with “agency” ought to live in our review.   (Interestingly, my “Crafting knowledge…” paper in PNAS – that was the basis of my talk to the UMN/ASU/UNAM group on Thursday – also emphasizes the importance of “capacity”, drawing on the work of my coauthors Lebel and van Kerkoff.
 
More generally, I’d be interested in your take on how this paper (eg. In the use of Giddens in the quote above) deals with structure / agency issues, and if that has something to teach us .  Or me.

	annote = {Thoughts on the paper (Harley)
Overall, this is a really cool paper in its efforts to combine a lot of different streams of research and bring them together in a way that analytically tackles how to bend the curve. 
At first I thought it fit well in the power section, but I actually don't think it fits very well anymore after thinking about it a lot. This is because it really fails to deal with where power or capacity comes from or how to grow it when power and capacity is maldistributed and the people with the power are driving the system in entirely unsustainable directions. 
 
My critique does not mean its not a valuable paper as it really does pull a lot of ideas together, but it would have been stronger perhaps if they thought about where the capacities come from, how they are grown when groups systematically lack them, and even how these capacities can overcome really deeply entrinched interests.  It is a really valuable contribution to the field, but its focus on overcoming entrinched power structures is somewhat burried, though it does show up. For example the fact that institutional change requires all four capacities makes sense to me, but it would be nice if they reflected more deeply on why this is.
 
Some high points of the paper;
"We employ the concept of capacities for understanding the abilities of actors in the scenarios to effectively mobilise, create and change capital stocks."

This seems to me the right take on what capacities ultimatly need to do--change the way stocks are built up or drawn down and who has access to control those stocks or the flows from those stocks.

The study demonstrates that social cost–benefit analysis and damage-limiting strategies can be usefully extended to illuminate issues with major long-term consequences, as well as concerns such as potential tipping points, irreversibility, and hysteresis. A key finding is that, under a wide range of assumptions, the risk of GIS disintegration makes a small contribution to the optimal stringency of current policy or to the overall social cost of climate change. It finds that the cost of GIS disintegration adds less than 5\% to the social cost of carbon (SCC) under alternative discount rates and estimates of the GIS dynamics.},

	abstract = {The concept of “pathways” has increasingly come to frame the challenge of transitioning to low-carbon societies. It also shows promise as a bridging concept, encouraging constructive dialogue among the diverse perspectives and constituencies evoking its use. However, its interpretations and attributes are rarely explicit and have yet to be subject to serious scrutiny. This raises important questions for both theory and governance as the way in which a problem is framed shapes how it is understood and addressed, structuring the possibilities considered and privileging certain responses. Therefore, this study explores the concept of pathways in the context of low-carbon transitions, exposing its conceptions, maturation, and implications. Based on a survey of the relevant climate change mitigation literature, this analysis uncovers three core conceptions of pathways in the context of low-carbon transitions: (1) biophysical, (2) techno-economic, and (3) socio-technical. Constituted by diverse perspectives and approaches, each of these three core conceptions emphasize different yet interconnected dimensions of the decarbonization challenge. This analysis also points to several key attributes and functions of the concept of pathways. Yet, while the concept may possess a variety of features that recommend its use as a critical problem frame for low-carbon transitions, it also raises issues that suggest a need for further reflexivity. If the concept is cast too strongly in terms of individual core conceptions, there may be a tendency to emphasize certain dynamics while paying somewhat less attention to others, inadvertently diminishing the complexity of the decarbonization challenge. Beyond this, there are other facets of the concept that have to date received more limited attention, including the implications of choices at critical junctures and the evolving character of social practices. So, there is room for the concept of pathways to engage more fully with the range of complexities embodied by low-carbon transitions.},

	abstract = {The need to adapt to climate change is now widely recognised as evidence of its impacts on social and natural systems grows and greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are framed within a “pathways” metaphor to emphasise the need for robust decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such “adaptation pathways” approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of “adaptation pathways” that draws on ‘pathways thinking’ in the sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions constrain societal responses to change. This re-conceptualisation of adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of adaptation.},

	abstract = {This paper is motivated by a concern that adaptation and vulnerability research suffer from an under-theorization of the political mechanisms of social change and the processes that serve to reproduce vulnerability over time and space. We argue that adaptation is a socio-political process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes. We propose that applying concepts of subjectivity, knowledges and authority to the analysis of adaptation focuses attention on this socio-political process. Drawing from vulnerability, adaptation, political ecology and social theory literatures, we explain how power is reproduced or contested in adaptation practice through these three concepts. We assert that climate change adaptation processes have the potential to constitute as well as contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge, thereby opening up or closing down space for transformational adaptation. We expand on this assertion through four key propositions about how adaptation processes can be understood and outline an emergent empirical research agenda, which aims to explicitly examine these propositions in specific social and environmental contexts. We describe how the articles in this special issue are contributing to this nascent research agenda, providing an empirical basis from which to theorize the politics of adaptation. The final section concludes by describing the need for a reframing of adaptation policy, practice and analysis to engage with multiple adaptation knowledges, to question subjectivities inherent in discourses and problem understandings, and to identify how emancipatory subjectivities – and thus the potential for transformational adaptation – can be supported.},

Analytic shortcomings are also beginning to appear, particularly in the treatment of power. Here we draw together diverse social science perspectives and research into a variety of cases to show how different types of power shape rule setting, issue construction, and policy implementation in polycentric governance.

This review examines theoretical and empirical literature from sustainability science, public administration, and science and technology studies (STS) with the intention of advancing the theory and practice of co-production within sustainability science. We argue that co-production must go beyond stakeholder engagement by scientists to the more deliberate design of societal transitions. Co-production can contribute to such transitions by shifting the institutional arrangements that govern relationships between knowledge and power, science and society, and state and citizens. We highlight critical weaknesses in conceptualizations of co-production within sustainability sciences with respect to power, politics, and governance. We offer suggestions for how this can be rectified through deeper engagement with public administration and STS to offer a broad vision for enhancing the use, design, and practice of a more reflexive co-production in sustainability science.

The first focuses at system performance, the second at system capacity to cope with change. The two schools of thought promote their own legitimacy, but undertake little effort to transcend their own perspective. Though, different scholars have pointed at the necessity of combining control and resilience for managing a system. We review the literature on control and resilience, synthesize the work in these fields into one coherent conceptual framework and reflect on the question whether control and resilience strategies can be reconciled or whether inevitable trade-offs are to be made. Based on a literature review, we develop a framework contrasting both rationales through their preferred (contrary) system attributes. Next, we discuss the operationalization of these system properties for policy development. Policies will generally reflect elements of both control and resilience. There will be trade-offs between preferred system attributes, where development of resilience restricts the development of possible control (and vice versa). The conceptual framework introduced provides a ‘language’ for contrasting and possibly (partly) reconciling the control and resilience rationales. Such a language is crucial for a meaningful policy discourse between actors, because it helps in understanding the implications of different rationales and in comparing alternative policies in terms of control and resilience.},

The dominant research tradition on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an actor-centered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional learning.},

	abstract = {In Integrated Assessment modelling of climate change impacts and adaptation, there are two main uses for measures of capacity to adapt to climate change. The first is to represent the capacity for proactive adaptation: this can be termed adaptive capacity. The second is to represent the capacity for reactive or instantaneous coping: this can be termed coping capacity. Adaptive capacity helps to determine which proactive adaptation options are feasible as inputs to the models under any given pair of climate and socio-economic scenarios. Coping capacity represents the residual ability to react to conditions, and influences vulnerability under any given set of model outputs. Using the example of the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, we explain how these capacities can be represented in integrated assessment. We demonstrate how an index of adaptive and coping capacity can be developed using a five-capitals (human, social, manufactured, natural, financial) model of societal wealth and incorporated in integrated assessment models. We find that for very aggregate applications, but not local or sectoral applications, the same indicators can be used to simulate adaptive and coping capacity. In addition, we argue that it is generally unnecessary to account for the depletion of capacity through adaptation itself, and that natural capital can generally be omitted from capacity measures if it is already directly represented in model outputs.},

This challenge can be viewed as a problem in which human society must navigate in a limited space of acceptable futures in which humans enjoy sufficient well-being and avoid crossing planetary boundaries. A critical obstacle is the nature of society as a controller with endogenous dynamics affected by knowledge, values, and decision-making fallacies. We outline an approach for analyzing the role of knowledge infrastructure in maintaining safe operating spaces. Using a classic natural resource problem as an illustration, we find that a small safe operating space exists that is insensitive to the type of policy implementation, while in general, a larger safe operating space exists which is dependent on the implementation of the “right” policy. Our analysis suggests the importance of considering societal response dynamics to varying policy instruments in defining the shape of safe operating spaces.},

However, actions to decrease variance over short timescales (2–4 y), when applied continuously, may lead to long-term ecosystem changes with adverse consequences. We investigated the effects of managing short-term variance in three well-understood models of ecosystem services: lake eutrophication, harvest of a wild population, and yield of domestic herbivores on a rangeland. In all cases, actions to decrease variance can increase the risk of crossing critical ecosystem thresholds, resulting in less desirable ecosystem states. Managing to decrease short-term variance creates ecosystem fragility by changing the boundaries of safe operating spaces, suppressing information needed for adaptive management, cancelling signals of declining resilience, and removing pressures that may build tolerance of stress. Thus, the management of variance interacts strongly and inseparably with the management of resilience. By allowing for variation, learning, and flexibility while observing change, managers can detect opportunities and problems as they develop while sustaining the capacity to deal with them.},

	abstract = {Developing effective governance structures for the fair and sustainable use of benefits that flow from shared natural resources is arguably one of the defining challenges of our time. Addressing this challenge has been extremely difficult because the associated governance problem is multifaceted and multilayered. Governance structures must address at least three interrelated issues: ( i ) equitable distribution within and across generations of affordances for well-being; ( ii ) social dilemmas associated with providing shared infrastructure and preventing overexploitation of shared resources; and ( iii ) coping with deep uncertainty and variability that complicates decision-making and planning efforts. Addressing these issues will often require us, both as individuals and in groups, to act against our natural tendencies. Familiar examples related to the first two issues include delaying rewards for the sake of future outcomes and overcoming our aversion to the “sucker’s pay-off” to build sufficient trust to address social dilemmas. Recent work suggests that this is also true when coping with uncertainty and variability in benefit flows while sustaining them over the long term. Specifically, Carpenter et al. (1) develop an important set of ideas related to managing environmental variability that may cause two of our natural aversions to collide. The authors suggest that we must learn to live with a certain amount of variability if we want to enlarge the safe operating space for exploited ecosystems. Just as with delayed rewards, humans are averse to variability in benefit flows related to subsistence (2, 3). More challenging yet, because allowing variability in ecosystems may well involve reduced exploitation, we may be required to forego present consumption as well as tolerate variability to maintain a safe operating space for humanity.

Of these challenges, coping with uncertainty and variation in benefit flows is the most difficult to conceptualize. Although all three are difficult to address in practice, …

This article provides an overview of complexity economics, and argues that it is incompatible with the “equilibrium” and “optimality” conceptions of the mainstream and its “market economy.” Instead, it develops older heterodox — including evolutionary-institutional — issues like self-organization, emergence, path‑dependence, idiosyncrasies, lock-ins, or skewed power distributions. Also, the space for emergent institutions through the “intentionality” of agents, including their improving collective performance, reducing complexity, and others, is investigated. This article considers complex adaptive systems through “games on networks” in an “evolution-of-cooperation” perspective. Moreover, a surge in policy implications of economic complexity has emerged, even if still rather general. With some more specific implications derived, the article again reveals the close similarities with long-standing heterodoxies: namely, pragmatist policy conceptions in this respect.},

Vulnerability is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and integration.},

"Conclusion.  Issues of place, well-being, and fairness affect how decisions emerge and gain legitimacy and determine the outcome of who benefits and who pays. Who benefits and who pays for adaptation is important intrinsically. But it is also important because when the burden of adaptation is perceived to be unfair, then action will not be legitimized and interventions simply will not happen."

In the past 20 years, complex adaptive systems have been sharpened from an abstract concept into a series of tools that can be used to solve concrete problems. These advances have been led by the development of new techniques for coupling ecological and evolutionary dynamics, for integrating dynamics across multiple scales of organization, and for using data to infer the complex interactions among different components of ecological systems. Focusing on the development and usage of these new methods, we discuss how they have led to an improved understanding of three universal features of complex adaptive systems, emergent patterns; tipping points and critical phenomena; and cooperative behavior. We restrict our attention primarily to marine ecosystems, which provide numerous successful examples of the application of complex adaptive systems. Many of these are currently undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic perturbations, and we take the opportunity to discuss how complex adaptive systems can be used to improve the management of public goods and to better preserve critical ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly between different regions and countries. It takes a critical stance on the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies’ socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative ‘global’ regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor networks and institutional rationalities, which influence transition dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on globalization theories from sociology and human geography, we show that socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese wastewater sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on wastewater infrastructure expansion were not only influenced by path-dependencies stemming from China’s national context, but equally (or even more critically) by the dominant rationality of the water sector’s global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global socio-technical regimes.},

This paper argues that the transition to ‘post-fossil urbanization’ is hampered by the lack of positive imaginations of alternative possible urban futures and post-fossil city life. It asks the question why it is so difficult to conceive of new possible urban worlds, and tries to answer it by using the established concept of ‘imaginary’ and introducing the concept of ‘technique of futuring’. The salience of the imaginary of the modern city is used as an example. The paper points at the International Society for Organization (ISO) and ‘living labs’ as contemporary techniques of futuring, organizing urban futures. It then aims to recoup one’s capacity to imagine alternative possible worlds and explores the role that academics can play in this endeavour.},

	abstract = {The need to rapidly decarbonise energy systems is widely accepted, yet there is growing criticism of ‘top–down’, technocentric transition visions. Transitions are, such critics claim, unpredictable, contested, and comprise of multiple and competing perspectives. This paper opens up to diverse visions of energy transitions by studying a corpus of 12 visions produced across different ‘institutional settings’ of the state, business, science and technology, and civil society in the UK. We introduce a new analytical framework grounded in relational co-productionist perspectives in science and technology studies (STS) to comparatively analyse the similarities and differences of the visions in relation to four dimensions of sociotechnical transformation: meanings, knowings, doings, and organisings. Whilst research on energy transitions often focuses on dominant imaginaries within political cultures, regimes and centres of power, it is an explicit intention of this paper to also comparatively map the distributed, diverse and counter-hegemonic visions. The paper reveals that what is often presented as a primarily ‘technical’ transition is always normative in bringing forward particular forms of social and political order. Our analysis reveals important distinctions between more ‘centred’ and more decentred or ‘alternative’ imaginaries of the energy transition, differences which reveal the inherently political nature of energy futures. Visions which emerge from civil society settings are shown to be a key locus of diversity in sociotechnical imaginaries and tend to open up to alternative models of progress, social change, and the roles of publics. This emphasises the significant role played by the settings and the make-up of collective practices through which energy visions are co-produced. We suggest that mapping diverse visions to reveal their respective partialities, exclusions and sociopolitical dimensions in this way, can offer a more humble, reflexive, and responsible foundation for practices of future-making and sociotechnical transformations.},

She argued, to the contrary, that higher levels of state action are often necessary to solve complex common-pool resource problems. In Ostrom's central concept of polycentrism, local decision making groups must often be “nested” within state structures at a higher level, so that the higher structures can provide the coercion and other resources that make local negotiation efficient. The state has four potentially crucial roles in a polycentric system. The first is to threaten to impose a solution (a “public-interest penalty default”) if local parties cannot come to a negotiated agreement. The second is to provide a source of relatively neutral information to mitigate the problem of self-serving bias regarding the relevant facts. The third is to provide an arena for negotiating that facilitates low-cost, enforceable agreements. The fourth is to help monitor compliance and sanction defection in the implementation phase. All four arise in Governing the Commons. Today we must also consider the international level, which has no state. Issues such as global warming therefore require that we build overarching institutions to perform these state functions while at the same time preserving the flexible, grounded, local knowledge and participant commitment that facilitate legitimate and efficient systems of cooperation.},

	abstract = {The 20th anniversary issue of Global Environmental Change provides an important opportunity to address the core questions involved in addressing “global environmental” problems—especially those related to climate change. Climate change is a global collective-action problem since all of us face the likelihood of extremely adverse outcomes that could be reduced if many participants take expensive actions. Conventional collective-action theory predicts that these problems will not be solved unless an external authority determines appropriate actions to be taken, monitors behavior, and imposes sanctions. Debating about global efforts to solve climate-change problems, however, has yet not led to an effective global treaty. Fortunately, many activities can be undertaken by multiple units at diverse scales that cumulatively make a difference. I argue that instead of focusing only on global efforts (which are indeed a necessary part of the long-term solution), it is better to encourage polycentric efforts to reduce the risks associated with the emission of greenhouse gases. Polycentric approaches facilitate achieving benefits at multiple scales as well as experimentation and learning from experience with diverse policies.},

Anthropogenic climate change is now adding strong trends on top of existing natural variability. These trends elevate the frequency of “surprises”—conditions that are unexpected based on recent history. Here, we show that the frequency of surprising ocean temperatures has increased even faster than expected based on recent temperature trends. Using a simple model of human adaptation, we show that these surprises will increasingly challenge natural modes of adaptation that rely on historical experience. We also show that warming rates are likely to shift natural communities toward generalist species, reducing their productivity and diversity. Our work demonstrates increasing benefits for individuals and institutions from betting that trends will continue, but this strategy represents a radical shift that will be difficult for many to make.},

Given the large number of goals, interactions are inevitable.

We use a trade-linked, consumption-based approach to assess interactions in 166 nations, each subdivided into four income groups. We find that pursuing social goals is, generally, associated with higher environmental impacts. However, interactions differ greatly among countries and depend on the specific goals. In both interactions, carbon experiences smaller changes than land and water. Although efforts by high- and low-income groups are needed, the rich have a greater leverage to reduce humanity’s footprints. Given the importance of both social and environmental sustainability, it is crucial that quantitative interactions between SDGs be well understood so that, where needed, integrative policies can be developed.},

Such systems have been analyzed through the lenses of sustainability (largely along the dimensions of environmental protection and affordability), carrying influence in the literatures of technology innovation, product design, infrastructure planning, and service delivery. Sustainability concerns along the environmental and financial dimensions have motivated focus on waste and emissions reduction, new technology development, and greening of industrial ecosystems. The concept of inclusive development, however, has not yet permeated the research or conceptualization of sociotechnical systems. Two streams of on-going work in inclusive innovation and in inclusive wealth analysis offer meaningful avenues for future connections. We discuss how the literature on sociotechnical systems and their constituent elements of engineered products and processes has evolved on the topic of sustainability, how the emerging concept of inclusive innovation bridges dimensions of environment and social inclusivity, and how inclusive wealth may inform system-level planning and analysis of sociotechnical systems moving forward.},

Bridging this divide only adds to the already daunting challenge of securing climate stabilization. In fact, efforts towards the former are more likely to conflict with the latter. To be able to address this dilemma, the relationship between energy consumption and human well-being, beyond its economic dimension, needs to be better understood. This paper aims to contribute to the emerging knowledge base, by examining this relationship using a proxy for human well-being that also considers its environmental and social dimensions. The ultimate goal of this paper is to investigate the potential incompatibility between efforts towards the achievement of higher collective well-being and those associated with climate stabilization. To this end, it provides estimates of the additional energy needed and its associated carbon emissions under different climate scenarios, and compares them with existing carbon budgets. Results indicate that even if new climate policies were adopted, emissions associated with higher well-being in all regions where improvements are needed could still reach up to one and a half times estimated 2°C budgets, and even more so for lower temperature increase targets.},

Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change.

	abstract = {The term tipping point has experienced explosive popularity across multiple disciplines over the last decade. Research on social-ecological systems (SES) has contributed to the growth and diversity of the term’s use. The diverse uses of the term obscure potential differences between tipping behavior in natural and social systems, and issues of causality across natural and social system components in SES. This paper aims to create the foundation for a discussion within the SES research community about the appropriate use of the term tipping point, especially the relatively novel term ‘social tipping point.’ We review existing literature on tipping points and similar concepts (e.g. regime shifts, critical transitions) across all spheres of science published between 1960 and 2016 with a special focus on a recent and still small body of work on social tipping points. We combine quantitative and qualitative analyses in a bibliometric approach, rooted in an expert elicitation process. We find that the term tipping point became popular after the year 2000—long after the terms regime shift and critical transition—across all spheres of science. We identify 23 distinct features of tipping point definitions and their prevalence across disciplines, but find no clear taxonomy of discipline-specific definitions. Building on the most frequently used features, we propose definitions for tipping points in general and social tipping points in SES in particular.},

Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

It has long been difficult to quantify resilience directly, forcing practitioners to rely on indirect static indicators of health. However, measurements from wearable electronics and other sources now allow us to analyze the dynamics of physiology and behavior with unsurpassed resolution. The resulting flood of data coincides with the emergence of novel analytical tools for estimating resilience from the pattern of microrecoveries observed in natural time series. Such dynamic indicators of resilience may be used to monitor the risk of systemic failure across systems ranging from organs to entire organisms.

The field of transition studies has been critically interrogated for undermining the role of power, which has inspired various endeavours to theorize power and agency in transitions. This paper presents the POwer-IN-Transition framework (POINT), which is developed as a conceptual framework to analyse power and (dis)empowerment in transformative social change, integrating transition concepts and multiple power and empowerment theories. The first section introduces transitions studies and discusses its state-of-the-art regarding power. This is followed by a typology of power relations and different types of power (reinforcive, innovative, transformative). These notions are then used to reframe transition concepts, in particular the multi-level perspective, in terms of power dynamics. The critical challenges of (dis)empowerment and unintended power implications of discourses on and policies for sustainability transitions' are discussed.

capacity by one actor may imply incapacity elsehwere

-- The mobilize resources seems right and the shaping institutions seems right and both align with the three dimensions of power. Perhaps she misses the largest landscape level role of power in shaping goals, perceptions and beliefs.
-- emphasizes the different types of power dynamics and the degree to which each matters. Opens up space for empowerment when you have less of some types of power or overall less power, but you still have some. How do you use it effectivly. This is after all the main question.
 
-- Grin (2010) discusses agency in transitions in terms of "agents capacity' of "acting otherwise" and triggering institutional transofmrtaion by "smartly playing into power dynamics at various layers"
 
-- FOCUS "how actors engage with resources, structures and systems in different ways."  Opening up the space for more systematic understanding of empowerment.
-- actor specific power: "actor-specific resources used in the pursuit of self-interest (weber) or power as capacity of a social system to mobilize resoruces to realize collective goals (Parsons, 1963).
 
Different types of power: A and B exercise a different type of power to/over
Her table is not very nuanced about how exactly power is exercised, but rather looks at relational power between two actors and how differential power combined with different types of goals overlays to create a number of diverse posibilities for outcomes.
 
She has a list of resource types for power from Avelino and Rotmans 2011--they are pretty well aligned with our asset stocks:

Human capital: She calls this Human which she defines as "human leverage; personnel, members, voters
Natural capital: She calls this natural and defines as "raw materials, physical space, time, organic life (not sure that time makes a lot of sense but I otherwise agree"
Manufactured capital: She calls this Artifactual and defines this as "Apparatuses, products, construction, infrastructure, Art (music, painting, photography, dance".. also a bit off from our binning but not too bad. 
Knowledge capital: Which she calls Mental and defines as information, concepts, ideas and beliefs.
SHE DOES NOT HAVE A SOCIAL CAPITAL, but she does have Monetorary capital whcih includes funds, chas, financial stocks.


She maps all of these resources onto the types of power that is exercised. Which is very interesting, but I think it could be even better if the bins were better defined.

Taking the case of the global automotive industry, the paper therefore analyses the evidence for systemic continuity in technologies, economic structures, cultural positioning and embedded social function through the lens of transition theory and the multi-level perspective. It is concluded that the observable processes are as much about enduring technologies and social practices as they are about systemic change. That is, the industry has shown resistance to change notwithstanding the apparent imperatives for radical action or the multitude of attempts via socio-technical experimentation to nurture strategic niches. At a theoretical level, it is concluded that greater attention must be paid to understanding how change can be nullified. Moreover, theoretical expectations of systemic change need a greater emphasis on the way in which technological transition as a process may mean that many existing practices and structures are retained more or less intact rather than entirely replaced by new practices and structures. The future research agenda needs therefore to understand more fully how embedded practices and technological change inter-relate in specific concrete conditions.},

I draw from a case study on the transition towards electric automobility in the Netherlands. From the analysis, eight strategic rationales for taking part in niche activities are distilled.

Previous work has analysed how the coevolution of technologies and institutions has led to the lock-in of current high-carbon energy systems; and how the coevolution of physical and social technologies and business strategies has brought significant material and welfare benefits to the minority of the world's population living in industrialised countries. The coevolutionary framework proposed here may be used to undertake: (1) detailed empirical analyses at a micro–meso level of the challenges relating to the innovation and adoption of particularly low-carbon technologies; (2) as a framework for analysing the multi-level interaction of social and technological elements within potential transition pathways to a low carbon energy system; (3) to assess the implications for economic growth and prosperity of a transition to a low carbon economy; and (4) to assist in the development of more formal, multi-level evolutionary economic models.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this synthesis paper is to present the motivations and conceptual basis for research on socio-technical-ecological systems (STES), addressing the need for interdisciplinary studies targeting the technological mediation of human\&ndash;environment relationships. The background is the very limited number of collaborations between scholars of social-ecological systems and sociotechnical systems (SES), despite repeated calls for bridging work. The synthesis builds on an in-depth review of previous literature, interdisciplinary exchanges, and empirical examples. The result is arguments for why a sociotechnical understanding of \&lsquo;technology\&rsquo; is of central importance for SES studies, related to how technology: (1) mediates human\&ndash;environment relationships; (2) brings ambivalence to these relationships; (3) enhances and transforms human agency and provides a source of constitutive power; (4) changes scalar relationships, enabling our interaction with and impact on the natural world across time and space. Furthermore, we present an STES analytical approach which starts from symmetrical attention to technology, society, and environment, specifically targeting interfaces and relationships of critical relevance for SES scholars, and address counterarguments that we have encountered. We conclude that a shift to STES research will enhance our knowledge of system interfaces that are often overlooked, opening further avenues for research and real-world interventions.},

	abstract = {Since the World War II, many economies have transitioned from an agrarian, biomass-based to an industrial, minerals-based metabolic regime. Since 1950, world population grew by factor 2.7 and global material consumption by factor 3.7–71Gigatonnes per year in 2010. The expansion of the resource base required by human societies is associated with growing pressure on the environment and infringement on the habitats of other species. In order to achieve a sustainability transition, we require a better understanding of the currently ongoing metabolic transition and its potential inertia. In this article, we present a long-term global material flow dataset covering material extraction, trade, and consumption of 177 individual countries between 1950 and 2010. We trace patterns and trends in material flows for six major geographic and economic country groupings and world regions (Western Industrial, the (Former) Soviet Union and its allies, Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa) as well as their contribution to the emergence of a global metabolic profile during a period of rapid industrialization and globalization. Global average material use increased from 5.0 to 10.3tons per capita and year (t/cap/a) between 1950 and 2010. Regional metabolic rates range from 4.5t/cap/a in Sub-Saharan Africa to 14.8t/cap/a in the Western Industrial grouping. While we can observe a stabilization of the industrial metabolic profile composed of relatively equal shares of biomass, fossil energy carriers, and construction minerals, we note differences in the degree to which other regions are gravitating toward a similar form of material use. Since 2000, Asia has overtaken the Western Industrial grouping in terms of its share in global resource use although not in terms of its per capita material consumption. We find that at a sub-global level, the roles of the world regions have changed. There are, however, no signs yet that this will lead to stabilization or even a reduction of global resource use.},

This paper proposes that these socio-technical systems are an expression of a limited number of meta-rules that, for the past 250 years, have driven innovation and hence system evolution in a particular direction, thereby constituting the First Deep Transition. Meeting the cumulative social and ecological consequences of the overall direction of the First Deep Transition would require a radical change, not only in socio-technical systems but also in the meta-rules driving their evolution – the Second Deep Transition. This paper develops a new theoretical framework that aims to explain the emergence, acceleration, stabilization and directionality of Deep Transitions. It does so through the synthesis of two literatures that have attempted to explain large-scale and long-term socio-technical change: the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, and Techno-economic Paradigm (TEP) framework.},

Such pictures may overstate the tractability of incumbency to conventional policy instruments and so inadvertently help reinforce it. Based on detailed analysis of ways in which longstanding concepts of structuration apply to socio-material change, a novel ‘configuring fields’ approach is proposed.

Harley {\textless}Alicia\_Harley@hks.harvard.edu{\textgreater}Sent: Tuesday, September 17, 2019 17:39To: Clark, William C. {\textless}william\_clark@hks.harvard.edu{\textgreater}Subject: Re: how deep is incumbency? (entrenched power in science, technology and innovation )
 




Hi Bill;
 
I read through the Stirling paper "How deep is incumbency?” With  a fine-tooth comb which took a while because its very dense. Here is my review which is also in Zotero. While its very dense, its well worth the effort as Stirling addresses many of the “what is the system” questions we have been struggling with and it may serve us well to adopt some of his language. 











BC: I started my comments on your comments below with your purple questions.   Maybe read those first, then come back up here for my secondary comments on your numbered points.  Also note that I have highlighted what seemed important to me with yellow in the text.











 
1. Stirling wants to expand the notion of incumbency from discipline specific like socio-technical incumbency to include any “domain of what might potentially be self to be salient to change in any given feature of the world, extends in principle to the totality of what exists or is variously imaginable around the world.” In other words, he is developing an approach that is balanced across multiple dimensions and perspectives on power and incumbency. “Without unduly redirecting scope for important nuances, disparities and context-specificities in particular settings [action situations].”  











BC: He has some great ideas that have me thinking where I wasn't.  But he also writes as though he lived permanently in the Great London Fog.
BC: His ambitions to be balanced notwithstanding, he pretty much ignores nature (see below).











 
2. Because he wants to be as general as possible he uses the language “social-material pathways”. Is the the language we should adopt? Does "social-material” capture all the flows of resource stocks? I think it does but please comment. 











BC: See my comments on your questions below.











 
3. His introduction is useful in that it highlights the many global challenges related to incumbency: “It is increasingly recognized that the depths and extents of particular kinds of incumbency often form a reason why so many grave worldwide problems remain so persistently unresolved — including inequality, oppression, climate disruption, ecological destruction, toxic pollution and nuclear risks, as well as perennial obscenity and waste of ward. Finding ways to balance incumbent interests on such issues present some of the most pressing political priorities in the contemporary world”. 











BC: Yes, I agree that this is great.   Just see below on my comments that not all stickyness or path dependence is due to power.











 
4. To understand incumbency he argues need tools to understand agency and the "capacity for action”. Stirling goes through a lot of dense theoretical discussion not all of which I found at helpful about how to think about agency but ultimately settles on structuration theory—its neither structure nor agency but both and a struggle between the two (our "yes and" argument). 











BC:  Agree.   You explained it better to me than he did.   But I agree that we were already where he wants to take us with your "yes and."  Thanks.











 
5. He has a figure that is very interesting as it maps different kinds of “socio-material positive-feedback dynamics” on axis that include whether the positive feedback dynamics are oriented more to structure or agency (e.g.  homeostasis vs entrapment) and whether the dynamics are more mechanistic or emergent (e.g. entrenchment vs technological-drift). Finally, he discussed the ways the dynamics are mainly apprehended from interpretive constructivist, to positive analytic to quantitative aggregative (see for example imaginaries as example of constructivist, path dependency as example of positive analytic and economics of scale as quantitative aggregative). SEE FIGURE ATTACHED. What is cool about the figure as it brings together different language to describe socio-material incumbency across a wide range of literatures that treat the phenomenon slightly differently. Structure people probably see incumbency as free from agency, but the figure reminds us that maintaining structure requires its own kind of agency in acts of “status due bias” and “routines”. 











BC:  I can imagine that this may help us get our thoughts in order.   But in my mind it is precisely the sort of "inside baseball" figure that we do NOT want to reproduce in a review that is supposed to speak to engineers and ecologists as well as social studies scholars.   Am I missing something?











 
6. “Socio-Material incumbency is fundamentally about power.” Stirling argues that all of the various definitions of “socio-material positive feedback” have one thing in common which is power which he defines as “different forms and conditions of ‘asymmetrically structuring agency’”. By asymmetric he means the power to create structures that "orient some onward course of events [development pathways] rather than others.”   This definition is confusing, but what he means by it is the power to organize the rules of the system I believe within a ’socio-material’ development pathway. I think all three dimensions of power that we usually talk about can collapse within the definition of “asymmetrically structuring agency” but I am not sure its usually useful to do this except to make the point that all three dimensions of power serve to reenforce socio-material incumbency (which is a useful point). 
 
7. The paper discusses two attributes of gradients of power including intensity and directionality. “First, there are the ’scalar intensities’ of power associated with any given candidate instance of incumbency. Second, there is the ‘vector directionality’ of associated orientations for change at any particular locus of interest.” I believe that both the issues of intensity and directionality help us (BS and AGH) think about using power gradients within development pathways of socio-material incumbency and modeling this as a CAS. The intensity and directionality would I believe imply something about the slop of the attractor domains that should be captured in our figure. 











BC (not, I hope, BS as you have labeled me above): I like the two dimensions of power / incumbency.   I am not sure about translating this into a practical notion of "power gradients" or about slopes... though slopes I can maybe imagine.











 
8. Use of the word focal. Here, the current socio-material pathway is referred to as the “focal socio-material pathway”. I have a few times brought up the possibility of replacing action situation with focal situation. Striling's use of focal pathway suggests that I am not alone in this preference. Thoughts?  Note that Geels ( 2011) also uses focal: "Positive and negative influences from other regimes on the focal regime are an understudied but promising topic."
** In Zotero you will find this paper highly marked up. 











BC:  See below.   I get virtually no hits to "focal" paired with anything relevant.   Why would we replace a term that is well know and used in the field with one that is not?











 
 
9. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the entire thrust of the paper is an argument against the reification of middle range theories like socio-technical regimes and regime incumbency. Stirling feels that the reification of social science theories lead to a tendency to engage in “eagle eye views” and cockpit-ism in policy solutions. He argues that “despite the wealth of evidence and experience qualifying romanticized aspirations to control the inconvenient fact that ’there is no cockpit’ in global governance remains effectively ignored." He feels that rather than an eagle-eyed perspective, we should have a worm-eyed perspective on socio-material regime incumbency where many factors are holding complex and overlapping regime type structures in place views of individual overly determined regime “development pathways” oversimply things. He would almost certainly say this about our \#\#SustSci framework. I don’t think this means we should not use it, but with due acknowledgement that while it is a birds eye view, the real world is clearly more complex. The usefulness of the framework is to help various disparate parts of the field communicate and not as a complete model for how the world works. 










BC:  I found the regime discussion to be very useful.   I think, however, that his effort to connect his very insightful remarks about regimes to his long standing rant against "top down" and "cockpits" does not entirely work.  So lets try to distinguish the strong argument he makes from the rest.   Here are some points of departure from my side:  













I see his helpful perspective on regimes to be something of a mix between STS perspectives (they are socially constructed) and Scott perspectives (top down prescription not only doesn't work, it reinforces power asymmetries) 
His rant on top down and cockpits is fair enough, the SDGs notwithstanding, and seems to me fully in line with Scott.   So is his argument that the pursuit of sustainability is ultimately a political affair.   We should be sure we are saying this emphatically up front.   I think I would even be prepared to introduce his views of incumbency as the ulitimate barrier to sustainability  in our Intro.
One of the other "strong" things I want to take from his paper is his observation that the power distributions of incumbency often run across multiple regimes (or whatever you call them).    This seems to me to be of fundamental importance.   I elaborate in my response to your questions below.
He is not quite consistent in his treatment of regimes.  For instance, at one point he defines them (citing reference 458) as "the dominant way that a societal function is fulfilled."   That is a view I could live with for "energy regimes" "food regimes" etc.    It is also consistent with the description I cite in the draft review of something like "characteristic behaviors" of the variables involved in fullfilling a societal function.   His real objection, which he reiterates, is with reference to "THE regime" (as though it were an autonomous thing, like a carbon atom) rather than a construction driven by our choice of which "societal function" to be interested in, our assessment of "the dominant way" power and other relationships are "structurated" (ugh!) to fulfill that function, etc.   I think that with due deference to STS and Scott we should be able to rescue "regimes" in a useful way for the review that he might even find acceptable.













 
My main questions for you are:


Should we adopt the term “socio-material incumbency” and "socio-material development pathway?? 

BC:  I like the term "incumbancy" and gather it has some standing in social science.   I think it could well complement our discussions of power and transitions.   The one thing we should be more careful than the author on is that not all forces keeping systems in their "regimes" (see below) or pathways are related to power.   Some really are entirely from the natural system (think interglacial climate regimes).   That said, as I seem to recall us arguing in ESPP11, even path dependence or regimes or segregation patterns that have "natural" roots get reenforced by human power and incumbancies.
BC:  I also like how he sums up his view of power (see below).
BC:  On "socio-material X" my view is that we should not adopt this term except perhaps in a footnote.    A couple of reasons.   

Throughout our drafts, we have been trying to reduce the use of jargon, use terms people are familiar with, and focus on big picture issues rather than the nuances of debates on the differences between closely related concepts (e.g. robustness and resilience).   This goes in the wrong direction (neither term gets any hits at the topic level in WoS).    
We are aiming in this review at emphasizing that sustainability must be based on an understanding of the the intertwined character of environment and development, nature and society, etc.   "Socio-material" is only marginally less narrow than the "socio-technical" I have ranted about before.  In both cases, tech is given special consideration as a part of society, and nature is ignored.   Even if one allows that the convoluted argument about "material" could include carbon flows or mercury flows, its hard to imagine any natural scientist believing that it captures "scrublands", and it literally excludes energy.    I believe that our current default for this modifier is "nature-society," which I don't love but which does the job of capturing environment and human development.    Our review of the lit shows the most frequently used (but misleading) term is "socio-ecological."   I do not see how "socio-material" is an improvement.


BC:  On "pathway" I think we are well served by "development" pathway.   Though maybe that is too social-centric, as is "socio-material development pathway.   Maybe we should be talking about something more balanced, like "pathway of nature-society coevolution" or "Anthropocene pathway."   But for the reasons noted above, I don't see his usage as an inclusive improvement for us.


This whole discussion as incumbency as structured by “asymmetrically structuring power” I think has to do with the gradients of the development pathways we have been thinking about drawing. It would be useful I think to think about this together a bit more and figure out exactly what we want in our figure of three potential attractor domains/regimes. What are the gradients with respect to incumbency, the power that creates the positive feedbacks of incumbency power and separately how do we layer inclusive wealth on all of this. 

BC: His usage is "power as asymmetrically structuring agency" (i.e. structuring agency, not "structuring power").   I like the idea, as I like his notion of "democracy" as "access by the least powerful to the capacities for challenging power" (pg. 16).   I think we should work with these, especially in (y)our treatment of a) structure/agency; b) power; c) capacity/capability.
BC: I also like "incumbency" as about authority and "more general concentrations of influence, privilege and power," and "a reason why so many grave worldwide problems remain so persistently unresolved.... Finding ways to to balance the effects of incumbent interests on such issues present some of the most pressing political priorities in the contemporary world."  If we skip over "socio-material" for the moment (see above), and imagine that we could reduce the density of jargon, I also like "a general definition for the central concept of socio-material incumbency as: a multiplexity of dynamics through which a particular pathway in interacting [everything] phenomena is reproduced by -- and reinforcing of -- associated power gradients."
BC:  I guess I don't understand your reference to "gradients of development pathways...."   
BC: On inclusive wealth, etc.   I guess I imagine that a past or forecast or scenario development pathway can be scored for sustainability in multiple ways.   We seem to be suggesting with our "necessary conditions...." to score each on 

IW (including access and weighting to reflect our equity concerns), 
adaptive capacity
capacity for sustainability transition... which I assume must include something about the capacity to break incumbancies (??)
We have skated around the Sen argument about empowerment/capacity/capability.    Perhaps those concerns fold into the 3 criteria above.   Perhaps we add a 4th about capability/power?   I think that would be consistent with this article.




Should we use focal instead of action situation. 

BC: In my view, no.  It is introducing new, barely used terminology (It has 3 instances over the last 10 years in topic searches in WoS, whereas Action situation has 46) for no clear advantage.   And it will be confusing if we keep using "focal scale" (which I realize he thinks is part of the problem).     My own not well articulated view is that we want to embrace his notion that dominant power gradients cut across particular regimes (or whatever he calls them), e.g. its the same US hegemony that reshapes trade treaties and climate treaties and defense treaties.... and the same concentrated wealth that shapes the energy regime and food regimes and so on.   And that that we need to separate our analysis of cross cutting power from our analysis of particular problems or regimes.



 
Overall the figures in the paper may be worth thinking through together as its really a tour de force.     BC: Happy to talk and the rest through.   Say when....
 
 

Thanks,
Alicia

	annote = {I read through the Stirling paper "How deep is incumbency?” With  a fine-tooth comb which took a while because its very dense. Here is my review which is also in Zotero. While its very dense, its well worth the effort as Stirling addresses many of the “what is the system” questions we have been struggling with and it may serve us well to adopt some of his language. 
 
1. Stirling wants to expand the notion of incumbency from discipline specific like socio-technical incumbency to include any “domain of what might potentially be self to be salient to change in any given feature of the world, extends in principle to the totality of what exists or is variously imaginable around the world.” In other words, he is developing an approach that is balanced across multiple dimensions and perspectives on power and incumbency. “Without unduly redirecting scope for important nuances, disparities and context-specificities in particular settings [action situations].”  
 
2. Because he wants to be as general as possible he uses the language “social-material pathways”. Is the the language we should adopt? Does "social-material” capture all the flows of resource stocks? I think it does but please comment. 
 
3. His introduction is useful in that it highlights the many global challenges related to incumbency: “It is increasingly recognized that the depths and extents of particular kinds of incumbency often form a reason why so many grave worldwide problems remain so persistently unresolved — including inequality, oppression, climate disruption, ecological destruction, toxic pollution and nuclear risks, as well as perennial obscenity and waste of ward. Finding ways to balance incumbent interests on such issues present some of the most pressing political priorities in the contemporary world”. 
 
4. To understand incumbency he argues need tools to understand agency and the "capacity for action”. Stirling goes through a lot of dense theoretical discussion not all of which I found at helpful about how to think about agency but ultimately settles on structuration theory—its neither structure nor agency but both and a struggle between the two (our "yes and" argument). 
 
5. He has a figure that is very interesting as it maps different kinds of “socio-material positive-feedback dynamics” on axis that include whether the positive feedback dynamics are oriented more to structure or agency (e.g.  homeostasis vs entrapment) and whether the dynamics are more mechanistic or emergent (e.g. entrenchment vs technological-drift). Finally, he discussed the ways the dynamics are mainly apprehended from interpretive constructivist, to positive analytic to quantitative aggregative (see for example imaginaries as example of constructivist, path dependency as example of positive analytic and economics of scale as quantitative aggregative). SEE FIGURE ATTACHED. What is cool about the figure as it brings together different language to describe socio-material incumbency across a wide range of literatures that treat the phenomenon slightly differently. Structure people probably see incumbency as free from agency, but the figure reminds us that maintaining structure requires its own kind of agency in acts of “status due bias” and “routines”. 
 
6. “Socio-Material incumbency is fundamentally about power.” Stirling argues that all of the various definitions of “socio-material positive feedback” have one thing in common which is power which he defines as “different forms and conditions of ‘asymmetrically structuring agency’”. By asymmetric he means the power to create structures that "orient some onward course of events [development pathways] rather than others.”   This definition is confusing, but what he means by it is the power to organize the rules of the system I believe within a ’socio-material’ development pathway. I think all three dimensions of power that we usually talk about can collapse within the definition of “asymmetrically structuring agency” but I am not sure its usually useful to do this except to make the point that all three dimensions of power serve to reenforce socio-material incumbency (which is a useful point). 
 
7. The paper discusses two attributes of gradients of power including intensity and directionality. “First, there are the ’scalar intensities’ of power associated with any given candidate instance of incumbency. Second, there is the ‘vector directionality’ of associated orientations for change at any particular locus of interest.” I believe that both the issues of intensity and directionality help us (BS and AGH) think about using power gradients within development pathways of socio-material incumbency and modeling this as a CAS. The intensity and directionality would I believe imply something about the slop of the attractor domains that should be captured in our figure. 
 
8. Use of the word focal. Here, the current socio-material pathway is referred to as the “focal socio-material pathway”. I have a few times brought up the possibility of replacing action situation with focal situation. Striling's use of focal pathway suggests that I am not alone in this preference. Thoughts?  Note that Geels ( 2011) also uses focal: "Positive and negative influences from other regimes on the focal regime are an understudied but promising topic."
** In Zotero you will find this paper highly marked up. 
 
9. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the entire thrust of the paper is an argument against the reification of middle range theories like socio-technical regimes and regime incumbency. Stirling feels that the reification of social science theories lead to a tendency to engage in “eagle eye views” and cockpit-ism in policy solutions. He argues that “despite the wealth of evidence and experience qualifying romanticized aspirations to control the inconvenient fact that ’there is no cockpit’ in global governance remains effectively ignored." He feels that rather than an eagle-eyed perspective, we should have a worm-eyed perspective on socio-material regime incumbency where many factors are holding complex and overlapping regime type structures in place views of individual overly determined regime “development pathways” oversimply things. He would almost certainly say this about our \#\#SustSci framework. I don’t think this means we should not use it, but with due acknowledgement that while it is a birds eye view, the real world is clearly more complex. The usefulness of the framework is to help various disparate parts of the field communicate and not as a complete model for how the world works. 
 
 
My main questions for you are:


Should we adopt the term “socio-material incumbency” and "socio-material development pathway?? 
This whole discussion as incumbency as structured by “asymmetrically structuring power” I think has to do with the gradients of the development pathways we have been thinking about drawing. It would be useful I think to think about this together a bit more and figure out exactly what we want in our figure of three potential attractor domains/regimes. What are the gradients with respect to incumbency, the power that creates the positive feedbacks of incumbency power and separately how do we layer inclusive wealth on all of this. 
Should we use focal instead of action situation.

	abstract = {Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven. Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime shifts and {\textgreater} 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {The concept of a poverty trap-commonly understood as a self-reinforcing situation beneath an asset threshold-has been very influential in describing the persistence of poverty and the relationship between poverty and sustainability. Although traps, and the dynamics that lead to traps, are defined and used differently in different disciplines, the concept of a poverty trap has been most powerfully shaped by work in development economics. This perspective is often constraining because, as many studies show, poverty arises from complex interactions between social and environmental factors that are rarely considered in development economics. A more integrated understanding of poverty traps can help to understand the interrelations between persistent poverty and key social and ecological factors, facilitating more effective development interventions. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical appraisal of existing trap conceptualizations in different disciplines, and to assess the characteristics and mechanisms that are used to explain poverty traps in rural contexts, thereby broadening the traps concept to better account for social-ecological interactions. Complementarities and tensions among different disciplinary, perspectives on traps are identified, and our results demonstrate that different definitions of traps share a set of common characteristics: persistence, undesirability, and self-reinforcement. Yet these minimum conditions are not sufficient to understand how trap dynamics arise from complex social-ecological interactions. To broaden the utility of the concept we propose a more social-ecologically integrated definition of traps that includes four additional considerations: cross-scale interactions, path dependencies, the role of external drivers, and social-ecological diversity. Including these wider dimensions of trap dynamics would help to better account for the diverse social-ecological feedbacks that produce and maintain poverty traps, and could strengthen strategies to alleviate poverty in a more integrated way.

This paper systematically identifies and examines research published between 2000 and 2017 that assesses urban adaptive capacity to climate change in developing countries. To critically examine this literature, we developed a conceptual framework of urban adaptive capacity. The framework focuses on key components of urban adaptive capacity in three dimensions: the characterization of adaptive capacity, the external factors mediating adaptive capacity, and the dynamics of adaptive capacity. The study sheds light on the spatial and scalar interactions of individuals, communities, and authorities’ adaptive capacities within urban areas and highlights the importance of governance and social institutions in shaping urban adaptive capacity. The work also finds shortcomings in the current assessment of urban adaptive capacity, with key gaps including a narrow focus on the range and types of adaptive capacity; limited assessment of the multilevel determinants, place-based processes, and urban determinants that shape adaptive capacity; and a lack of consideration of adaptive capacity interactions between social entities and with regard to climate sensitivity and exposure of a given area, including the potential for maladaptation. Addressing these research gaps would contribute to generate knowledge that can adequately support adaptation planning of urban areas in developing countries.},

Posterity brings great uncertainties. Even massive losses, such as human extinction, however, do not merit infinite negative utility. Given learning, greater uncertainties about damages could increase or decrease the optimal level of current mitigation activities.

	abstract = {Social-ecological network (SEN) concepts and tools are increasingly used in human-environment and sustainability sciences. We take stock of this budding research area to further show the strength of SEN analysis for complex human-environment settings, identify future synergies between SEN and wider human-environment research, and provide guidance about when to use different kinds of SEN approaches and models. We characterize SEN research along a spectrum specifying the degree of explicit network representation of system components and dynamics. We then systematically review one end of this spectrum, what we term ‘fully articulated SEN’ studies, which specifically model unique social and ecological units and relationships. Results show a larger number of papers focus on methodological advancement and applied ends. While there has been some development and testing of theories, this remains an area for future work and would help develop SENs as a unique field of research, not just a method. Authors have studied diverse systems, while mainly focusing on the problem of social-ecological fit alongside a scattering of other topics. There is strong potential, however, to engage other issues central to human-environment studies. Analyzing the simultaneous effects of multiple social, environmental, and coupled processes, change over time, and linking network structures to outcomes are also areas for future advancement. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN research, a necessary step that can help scholars develop comparable cases and fill research gaps.},

	abstract = {Access to ecosystem services and influence on their management are structured by social relations among actors, which often occur across spatial scales. Such cross-scale social relations can be analysed through a telecoupling framework as decisions taken at local scales are often shaped by actors at larger scales. Analyzing these cross-scale relations is critical to create effective and equitable strategies to manage ecosystem services. Here, we develop an analytical framework –i.e. the ‘cross-scale influence-dependence framework’- to facilitate the analysis of power asymmetries and the distribution of ecosystem services among the beneficiaries. We illustrate the suitability of this framework through its retrospective application across four case studies, in which we characterize the level of dependence of multiple actors on a particular set of ecosystem services, and their influence on decision-making regarding these services across three spatial scales. The ‘cross-scale influence-dependence framework’ can improve our understanding of distributional and procedural equity and thus support the development of policies for sustainable management of ecosystem services.},

(2) Findings in the burgeoning field of behavioral economics have made it clear that individuals routinely depart significantly from rational prescriptions when making choices over time, thus undermining a bulwark of the discounting approach. These two sets of dilemmas are addressed in a series of papers under the headings normative analyses and behavioral analyses.

Capitalism is on the verge of destroying the planet and destabilizing society as wealth rushes to the top. The time for action is running short. Rebecca Henderson's rigorous research in economics, psychology, and organizational behavior, as well as her many years of work with companies around the world, gives us a path forward. She debunks the worldview that the only purpose of business is to make money and maximize shareholder value. She shows that we have failed to reimagine capitalism so that it is not only an engine of prosperity but also a system that is in harmony with environmental realities, striving for social justice and the demands of truly democratic institutions. Henderson's deep understanding of how change takes place, combined with fascinating in-depth stories of companies that have made the first steps towards reimagining capitalism, provides inspiring insight into what capitalism can be. With rich discussions of how the worlds of finance, governance, and leadership must also evolve, Henderson provides the pragmatic foundation for navigating a world faced with unprecedented challenge, but also with extraordinary opportunity for those who can get it right"--},

The review synthesises and reflects upon insights of relevance for sustainability transitions following from analyses of the importance of place specificity and the geography of inter-organisational relations. It is found that these contributions focus on the geography of niche development rather than regime dynamics, and that there is an emphasis on understanding the importance of place-specificity at the local level. While there is a wide consensus that place-specificity matters there is still little generalisable knowledge about how place-specificity matters for transitions. Most contributions add spatial sensitivity to frameworks from the transitions literature, but few studies suggest alternative frameworks to study sustainability transitions. To address this, the review suggests promising avenues for future research on the geography of sustainability transitions, drawing on recent theoretical advancements in economic geography.},

To do so, we analyze a sample of 163 articles from 2004 to 2014 using a standardized coding framework. The results provide an in-depth assessment of the status of the literature on learning in the context of environmental policy, as well as the quality of the literature. We demonstrate that despite the diversity in research questions and goals, the literature is lacking with respect to diversity in cases and context, theoretical development, clear conceptualization and operationalization of learning, and advancements in empirical approaches to study learning. From these insights, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for scholars in studying learning and provide recommendations for building the theoretical and methodological rigor of the field.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses whether ExxonMobil Corporation has in the past misled the general public about climate change. We present an empirical document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187 climate change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and paid, editorial-style advertisements (‘advertorials’) in The New York Times. We examine whether these communications sent consistent messages about the state of climate science and its implications—specifically, we compare their positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious, and solvable. In all four cases, we find that as documents become more publicly accessible, they increasingly communicate doubt. This discrepancy is most pronounced between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for expressions of reasonable doubt, 83\% of peer-reviewed papers and 80\% of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12\% of advertorials do so, with 81\% instead expressing doubt. We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science—by way of its scientists’ academic publications—but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil’s discussion of the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed and sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent from advertorials. Finally, based on the available documents, we outline ExxonMobil’s strategic approach to climate change research and communication, which helps to contextualize our findings.},

Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy.

In this work the author analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality. He shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality, the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth, today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values if political action is not taken. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, the author says, and may do so again. This original work reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Griggs et al. (2013) redefine sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present while
safeguarding Earth’s life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depend.” We recommend this as the
end goal that the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) should strive to achieve. Integration across the SDGs is less
than what is required from a science perspective. Effective implementation of the SDGs will require States to attend to trade-offs and
overlaps. We argue that continuous failure to address integration within the SDGs will jeopardize realization of this ultimate end goal.
Therefore, we adopt a systems approach to identify gaps and connections across the goals and targets of the SDGs as well as leverage
points for effective intervention. We triangulate across methods of critical analysis, conceptual modeling, and keyword network analysis
to draw out seven “overarching directions” that could provide a prioritization framework to enhance efficient implementation of the
SDGs. Our results identify main gaps as exclusion of key actors (e.g., corporations) and issues (e.g., intergenerational equity and
population); inadequate reconciliation of economic growth with maintaining the Earth system; and deficient consideration of the
relationship with international law. Conceptual mapping identifies education and innovation; governance and implementation;
sustainable consumption and production; and addressing the key drivers of climate change as key leverage points. The keyword analysis
highlights greater integration within the SDGs than what appears at face value. Keywords “access,” “women,” “resources,” and “finance”
feature across the SDGs and provide further leverage points. Targeting these issues will facilitate realization of a high proportion of
SDGs and correspondingly could have a disproportional impact on effective SDG implementation. We conclude that the success of
the SDGs needs to be evaluated by the extent to which it contributes to human development while advancing protection of “planetary
must-haves” for current and future generations.},

	abstract = {Among recent high-profile propositions to revise national accounts and to provide new indicators of sustainability and well-being, the inclusive wealth framework and the related inclusive wealth index (IWI) undoubtedly stand out as one of the most promising endeavours. Built up at the confluence of welfare, development and sustainability economics, the indicator has been designed to bring information about the wealth of nations and their sustainability, in a comprehensive way. The inclusive wealth framework is nevertheless fraught with limitations, due to questionable theoretical assumptions, gaps in data availability, unrealistic assumptions about the future and inability to account for distributional issues. We propose a non-exhaustive critical appraisal of the index and its underlying framework. We conclude that these limitations undermine its capacity to fulfil the requirements of a satisfactory sustainability indicator. We argue that most problems lie in the substantial discrepancy between the inclusive ambition of the indicator and the scarce means to implement it. Whereas the interconnectedness of the various assets that constitute wealth as well as their complex evolution through time are acknowledged by the proponents of inclusive wealth, the way the IWI is computed is rather a mere addition of layers of actuarial-like monetary values for a (not inclusive yet) range of capital assets. Caution is thus warranted while using such an approach, and shorter-range alternatives to pursue similar goals are proposed.},

The stakes have never been higher. Recent years have seen a rapid escalation of inequalities, the rise of new global powers and corporate interests, increasing impunity of human rights violations, suppression of civil society, and a re-shaping of democratic processes by post-truth, populist and nationalist politics.

Rather than looking at power through the lenses of agency or structure alone, this book views power and empowerment as complex and multidimensional societal processes, defined by pervasive social norms, conditions, constraints and opportunities. Bridging theory and practice, the book explores real-world applications using a selection of frameworks, tools, case studies, examples, resources and reflections from experience to support actors to analyse their positioning and align themselves with progressive social forces.

Compiled with social change practitioners, students and scholars in mind, Power, Empowerment and Social Change is the perfect volume for anyone involved in politics, international development, sociology, human rights and environmental justice who is looking for fresh insights for transforming power in favour of relatively less powerful people.},

The Scheve and Stasavage piece on inequality and democracy is a useful citation for the equity section because we can use it to say that we still don’t have a lot of empirical evidence that links inequality and participation, nor participation and sustainability in the aggregate. That said, the whole piece shows that the three causal reasons why democracy is not always linked to lower inequality is POWER. They dont come out and say this explicitly, but all three mechanisms they describe for why democracy does not empirically lead to lower inequality are power arguments. So I think the citation is useful for two reasons. The first is that we still don’t have very clean empirical patterns about relationship between inequality and empowerment (e.g. through democracy) but we also know that power matters in that its what is causing the story to be complex rather than the predicted “democracy should lead to people voting for inequality reducing policies". This combined with data on the capture of the state by fossil fuel interests is all the evidence I think we need to say that we need to study empowerment both for our “ends” argument around equity as part of all sustainability goals, but also because despite the complexity of the relationship between inequality, democracy and other sustainability outcomes (e.g. environmental degradation often associated with poverty, but sometimes also collective action and CPR management overcomes this), its hard to imagine actually constraining the behavior of powerful bad actors who want to plunder resources for their own benefit at the expense of vulnerable population today and future generations without finding ways to constrain their power or empower other actors relative to them. The goal is perhaps to have rights for these groups, but these rights have to be fought for and defended. Thus, empowerment is still a key capacity for SD even if the link between empowerment and SD outcomes are very complex.

Abstract: What do we know about wealth inequality and democracy? Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evi- dence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter pref- erences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the ev- idence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research. 
1. We assume democratic societies should be more equal because people should vote for this, but empirically it is not always the case. 
"If one were asked to sum up the received wisdom about these questions, it would be that wealth inequality is bad for democracy, and yet democracies are also likely to implement policies that reduce wealth inequality. The simple reason for this is that those with no or little wealth are more numerous and therefore have more votes than the wealthy."




"There is little evidence of an automatic link between democracy and wealth inequality. Democracy has many virtues, but it does not necessarily put societies on a path to greater wealth equality. This is not because public policy does not make a difference but rather because democracies do not necessarily implement wealth-equalizing policies." 
They give many reasons. Latent in all of them is power. But its amazing that they dont often explicitly mention this. I have assigned my own view of what dimensions of power each of their explanations is talking about. Need for causal identification seems to make them quite circumspect about talking about power. This is both a good and a bad thing--we should be humble in our claims, but perhaps still make them..... See the agrument of Rodrik about policies to reembed inequality in his recent blog post.




2.  Why?

When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth --{\textgreater} fight about other things and vote on those things. E.g. Abortion. So work to create these cleavages if you want to mainatine inequality. 3rd dimension.
Change peoples beliefs about the fairness of redistribution. So perhaps that they will also be impacted or their future selves might be impacted. Or it will slow economic growth because everyone up by their bootstraps. 3rd dimension
Capture the democratic process. 2nd dimension

 
DETAILS
1. Snowballing properties of wealth inequality. CItations to Benhabib \& Bisin 2016. 
2. Wealth inequality tends to evolve slowly over time. Therefore if we want to understand its determinants, we should consider long-run evidence.
3. Seems not a clear link between levels of inequality and long term outcomes in terms of type of political regime chosen. But the whole debate is contested by scholars. Key message is that there is minimal evidence for a link between inequality and democracy.
4. Nicely for my own work, they argue that land in most socities is a good proxie for inequality. They note that. "With the caveat that land inequality is extremely persistent over time (the correlation between land inequality circa 1950 and land inequality circa 1990 is 0.90), estimation of a difference-in-differences specification suggested no correlation whatsoever between land inequality and democracy."
5. Manipulating fairness priors: "




 Piketty (1995) examined how individuals can draw from their personal and family experience to infer (potentially with error) whether income is acquired as a result of luck or effort, and he suggested that this would guidevoterpreferences.Be ́nabou\&Tirole(2006)extendedthistoasettingwhereindividualscan manipulate their own beliefs (or those of their children) to maintain effort. Important earlier work in political science by Lane (1959) and Hochschild (1986) considered how individuals form beliefs about whether the distribution of resources in society is fair and how these beliefs influence their policy preferences." 
6. Evidence for importance of norms: "In our study Taxing the Rich (Scheve \& Stasavage 2016), we demonstrated how citizens’ fairness perceptions influence a government’s decisions on how heavily to tax its wealthiest citizens. As a result of that influence, fairness perceptions, and in particular changing fairness perceptions, have influenced the distribution of wealth." 
7. They cite Lindblom's market as prison piece. Which means they are clearly smart. ;-)




"A second approach to captured democracy is to suggest not that wealth inequality in general generates capture, but instead that wealth inequality in the context of a market economy generates capture. This is the phenomenon that Lindblom (1982) referred to as “the market as prison.” Likewise, Przeworski \& Wallerstein (1988) suggest how the state can be “structurally dependent” on owners of capital because without their investments the economy will not flourish." 
8. Useful for ARER power argument: behavior of legislatures goes along with high income Constituents. Easier to measure in US state legislators dont always vote with party and where votes are transparent recorded.




"A third approach to investigating captured democracy is to measure the extent to which the behavior of legislators is most highly correlated with that of their high-income constituents. Using this approach, Bartels (2008) provided initial evidence for a bias of this sort. Gilens (2012) then provided more extensive evidence that pointed in exactly the same direction. This approach provides a useful way of thinking about captured democracy." 
 
9. Capture through resources: Easier to measure in US where lobbying is legal but transparent. Harder elsewhere. 




"A fourth approach is to consider explicitly how those with wealth are able to use their resources to capture policy making. This has been considered in a general theoretical setting by Acemoglu \& Robinson (2008)."

My Take Overall: I did not find this paper very interesting. Its like political science suddenly realized that future generations exist and decided to review the literature and arguments that SustSci and philosophy have been aware of for a while. They go through a lot of nuance, but nothing really helps us think about HOW to include future generations, they are rather thinking about whether their is a future generation obligation and if so what it looks like-- e.g. is it ok to leave debt to future generations.
That said, it reviews a lot of the literature on goals from philosophy, so if we are trying to cite recent Annual Review papers, than we can cite it. Its just not that well done.
The most interesting parts to me looked at the question of political responsibilities to the future.
"By this, I mean the responsibilities that focus on political institutions and ask what respecting future generations requires in terms of either (a) creating new political institutions and reforming existing ones or (b) respecting future political institutions. One approach is essentially instrumental and is centered on a. It starts by reflecting on what economic and ecological responsibilities one generation has to future generations, and it then argues that current generations should design political institutions so that (consistent with other moral values) they best realize these principles of intergenerational justice. The political responsibilities to the future are thus defined in terms of responsibilities to create and maintain institutions that further intergenerational distributive justice (Caney 2016). A related instrumental approach argues that current generations have political responsibilities to protect the functioning of democratic institutions in the future (Thompson 2010)."
This to me is an argument that should be back up in sustained under social capital. --{\textgreater} so goes with our own argument nicely, but from the political science view.  The question of course for governance and empowerment is how to do this....
 




Key Points

Discussion of whether or not future generations includes those who are not yet citizens... cant vote. Different organizations who advocate for future generations treat this differently. 
Discussion of distant future vs our kids... no conclusion just point not very systematically to some points of the debate. 
Geographical scope: do we care about all future, or just those in our country? 
The most interesting part is around a close read of Rawls perspective on future generations (see quotes below). Rawls early work did not think very cogently about this. In particular the issue of declining natural capital and potential tipping points. Perhaps the issues of intergenerational sustainability are unique to the Anthropocene that Rawls was a bit before (my own thoughts). 
That said, by end of career, had a view of intergenerational justice that very much supports the sustained argument. 

"agree to a savings principle subject to the further condition that they must want all previous generations to have followed it. Thus the correct principle is that which the members of any generation (and so all generations) would adopt as the one their generation is to follow and as the principle they would want preceding generations to have followed (and later generations to follow), no matter how far back (or forward) in time. (Rawls 1993, p. 274; see also Rawls 1971, p. 289) "


Discussion of fair shares of what.... 

resources (Barry 1991)
capabilities to function (Sen 2009 and Nussbaum 2011)



Other interesting points:
Some interesting notes on Rawls:

"Given the influence of Rawls’s theory of distributive justice, it is natural to start by considering how his theory treats future generations. His account of justice to future generations in A Theory of Justice (Rawls 1971) has four core elements. The first concerns the membership of the contract. Rawls argues that the parties to the “original position” are the members of a single generation (Rawls 1971, pp. 140, 292), and he rejects proposals that the original position should include all who will exist or who could exist (Rawls 1971, p. 139). The second feature concerns the motivations of the parties. Rawls here departs from his general assumption that the parties are “mutually disin- terested,” writing that the parties (who, recall, are “heads of families”) care about their immediate descendants. As he puts it, “their goodwill stretches over at least two generations” (Rawls 1971, p. 128). The third feature of his approach is his assumption that principles of distributive justice (such as the Difference Principle) hold only among schemes of reciprocity. He further holds that different generations are not engaged in a scheme of reciprocity with each other and so concludes that the Difference Principle does not apply across time (Rawls 1971, p. 291)."
"His assumption here takes us back to A8. The Rawlsian approach maintains that we cannot simply apply the same prin- ciple to future generations that we would apply to contemporaries, for, on his account, there is a morally significant difference. Reciprocity exists among contemporaries but not between one gen- eration and subsequent nonoverlapping ones. We know then what the parties would not choose. But what would they choose? Rawls’s answer—the fourth feature of his approach—is that the par- ties would select a “just savings principle” (Rawls 1971, pp. 284–93). This, interestingly, is focused on passing on just institutions to future generations, and it is not concerned with wealth except insofar as that is needed to create and support just institutions."






"agree to a savings principle subject to the further condition that they must want all previous generations to have followed it. Thus the correct principle is that which the members of any generation (and so all generations) would adopt as the one their generation is to follow and as the principle they would want preceding generations to have followed (and later generations to follow), no matter how far back (or forward) in time. (Rawls 1993, p. 274; see also Rawls 1971, p. 289)"

This article lays out a framework that integrates classical and experimental approaches within a common theoretical structure based on the diverse capacity challenges states face with respect to extraction, coordination, and compliance. Addressing each in turn, we show that state capacity is an interactive process, the product of institutions governing relations between the state, mass publics, and bureaucrats. We argue that the institutions ensuring capacity and the processes that bring them into being vary. Our review highlights trends in recent research, as well as relevant differences in opportunities for and obstacles to empirical work on the subject.},

We describe how different scientific approaches and methodological positions explore diverse types of transitions and provide the basis for multiple theories and models for governance of sustainability transitions. We distinguish three perspectives in studying transitions: socio-technical, socio-institutional, and socio-ecological. Although the field as a whole is very heterogeneous, commonalities can be characterized in notions such as path dependencies, regimes, niches, experiments, and governance. These more generic concepts have been adopted within the analytical perspective of transitions, which has led three different types of approaches to dealing with agency in transitions: analytical, evaluative, and experimental. The field has by now produced a broad theoretical and empirical basis along with a variety of social transformation strategies and instruments, impacting disciplinary scientific fields as well as (policy) practice. In this article, we try to characterize the field by identifying its main perspectives, approaches and shared concepts, and its relevance to real-world sustainability problems and solutions.},

The predominant school of thought argues that poverty is a major cause of environmental degradation and if policy makers want to address environmental issues, then they must first address the poverty problem. Another school of thought argues that a direct link between poverty and environmental degradation is too simplistic and the nexus is governed by a complex web of factors. In this paper, a formal structure for analyzing the complex web of factors is formulated and used to review the existing literature on the links between poverty and the degradation of four natural resource sectors. The analysis highlights the important role institutional and market failure in encouraging agents from various income groups to exhibit unsustainable activities which in turn forces some of the agents to fall into poverty. Another important factor is the role of conflicts between different agents (income groups) in the povertyenvironmental degradation nexus. The analysis also highlights the presence of feedback loops between environmental degradation and poverty.},

The Great Leveler is the first book to chart the crucial role of violent shocks in reducing inequality over the full sweep of human history around the world. Ever since humans began to farm, herd livestock, and pass on their assets to future generations, economic inequality has been a defining feature of civilization. Over thousands of years, only violent events have significantly lessened inequality. The "Four Horsemen" of leveling--mass-mobilization warfare, transformative revolutions, state collapse, and catastrophic plagues--have repeatedly destroyed the fortunes of the rich. Scheidel identifies and examines these processes, from the crises of the earliest civilizations to the cataclysmic world wars and communist revolutions of the twentieth century. Today, the violence that reduced inequality in the past seems to have diminished, and that is a good thing. But it casts serious doubt on the prospects for a more equal future. An essential contribution to the debate about inequality, The Great Leveler provides important new insights about why inequality is so persistent--and why it is unlikely to decline anytime soon." -- Publisher's description},

We also define indicators and threshold values for each of these dimensions; in addition, we show how 167 countries compare in meeting these threshold values. Currently, no country meets all four thresholds. Even so, we propose that, with the use of technology and behavioural changes, it will be possible to reach the threshold values by 2030.},

The proponents of the approach consider nudges highly effective and efficient instruments to address societal problems which are rooted in individual behaviour. Nudging is regarded as a particularly promising approach to tackle persistent unsustainable behaviour patterns in fields such as energy or food consumption. Yet, the discussion about the potential contributions of nudging to sustainability governance is only at its beginning. This chapter adds to the burgeoning discussion about ‘nudging sustainability’ in conceptual respects. It does so by critically reflecting on nudging from a theoretically informed sustainability perspective. The analysis reveals that there are important tensions between nudging and different sustainability conceptions. These tensions should be carefully taken into consideration in further research and practice on the role of nudges in sustainability governance.},

Practitioners and scholars who fall into panacea traps falsely assume that all problems of resource governance can be represented by a small set of simple models, because they falsely perceive that the preferences and perceptions of most resource users are the same. Readers of this special feature will become acquainted with many cases in which panaceas fail. The articles provide an excellent overview of why they fail. Furthermore, the articles in this special feature address how scholars and public officials can increase the prospects for future sustainable resource use by facilitating a diagnostic approach in selecting appropriate starting points for governance and monitoring, as well as by learning from the outcomes of new policies and adapting in light of effective feedback.},

Indeed, from Indonesian sweatshops to oil-based violence in Nigeria, the challenges of regulating harmful corporate practices in some of the world s most difficult regions long seemed insurmountable. Human rights groups and businesses were locked in a stalemate, unable to find common ground. In 2005, the United Nations appointed John Gerard Ruggie to the modest task of clarifying the main issues. Six years later, he had accomplished much more than that. Ruggie had developed his now-famous "Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights," which provided a road map for ensuring responsible global corporate practices. The principles were unanimously endorsed by the UN and embraced and implemented by other international bodies, businesses, governments, workers organizations, and human rights groups, keying a revolution in corporate social responsibility. Just Business tells the powerful story of how these landmark Ruggie Rules came to exist. Ruggie demonstrates how, to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem, he had to abandon many widespread and long-held understandings about the relationships between businesses, governments, rights, and law, and develop fresh ways of viewing the issues. He also takes us through the journey of assembling the right type of team, of witnessing the severity of the problem firsthand, and of pressing through the many obstacles such a daunting endeavor faced. Just Business is an illuminating inside look at one of the most important human rights developments of recent times. It is also an invaluable book for anyone wanting to learn how to navigate the tricky processes of global problem-solving and consensus-building and how to tackle big issues with ambition, pragmatism, perseverance, and creativity."–Publisher description.},

Each of these draws attention to different dimensions of social–ecological systems, with their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the sustainability of social–ecological systems. Therefore we present a typology which defines and summarizes the three major types of fit and can be used to organize and advance systematic theoretical and policy relevant inquiry.},

	abstract = {Assessment of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has largely focused on formulating appropriate targets and indicators for each goal. Much less attention has been devoted to estimating possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the various SDGs. Yet such tradeoffs and complementarities clearly exist. We develop an analytical model to estimate the welfare effects of progress in attaining one SDG while accounting for interactions in achieving other SDGs. We assess quantitatively progress in the SDGs over 2000–2016 at the global level and for low-income countries, using a representative indicator for each goal. We then estimate the welfare changes for improvements in No Poverty (SDG1) net of any welfare gains and losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals. For the world, we estimate the per capita welfare change of reductions in 2000–2016 poverty rates net of any gains or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals is \$12,737 per capita. This is more than double the welfare change of \$5671 per person for poverty reduction alone from 2000 to 2016. However, once interactions with other SDGs are taken into account, the net welfare change for poverty reduction in poor economies from 2000 to 2016 is \$244 per person, which is almost 20\% lower than the welfare estimate of \$299 per capita of poverty reduction on its own. Such an analysis helps policy makers prioritize improvements towards one goal or set of goals, and show explicitly the net gains and losses for achieving one goal while impacting others. For example, over 2000–2016 the world may have come closer to attaining the No Poverty goal, but at the expense of other critical SDGs, especially those associated with the environment. This research has important implications for achieving sustainability through pursuit of the SDGs.},

	abstract = {Modern energy systems have tended towards centralized control by states, and national and multinational energy companies. This implicates the power of elites in realizing low-carbon transitions. In particular, low-carbon transitions can create, perpetuate, challenge, or entrench the power of elites. Using a critical lens that draws from geography, political science, innovation studies, and social justice theory (among others), this article explores the ways in which transitions can exacerbate, reconfigure or be shaped by “elite power.” It does so by offering a navigational approach that surveys a broad collection of diverse literatures on power. It begins by conceptualizing power across a range of academic disciplines, envisioning power as involving both agents (corrective influence) and structures (pervasive influence). It then elaborates different types of power and the interrelationship between different sources of power, with a specific focus on elites, including conceptualizing elite power, resisting elite power, and power frameworks. The Review then examines scholarship relevant to elite power in low-carbon transitions—including the multi-level perspective, Michel Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Anthony Giddens, Karl Marx, and other contextual approaches—before offering future research directions. The Review concludes that the power relations inherent in low-carbon transitions are asymmetrical but promisingly unstable. By better grappling with power analytically, descriptively, and even normatively, socially just and sustainable energy futures become not only more desirable but also more possible.},

The coding manuals which accompany CPR frame-works-in addition to providing guidelines for connecting empirical case work to conceptual variables-define a vocabulary of coding questions. For empirical work, connecting variables and coding questions with framework elements contributes to conceptual advance. In the process of analysis and publication, it is tempting to offer a novel framework without also developing, applying, or modifying the foundational questions and variables of coding manuals buttressing said frameworks. However, if the scholarly community is to generate robust knowledge for the study of CPR dilemmas, we must provide the underlying work of comparing across frameworks. In this paper, we report on one way the community might conduct such comparisons. We present results and challenges of using a group consensus process to link the more than 450 coding questions derived from the original Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IADF) to the recently proposed Coupled Infrastructure Systems Framework (CISF). Despite overlap, discrepancies in the conceptual positions of the IADF and CISF suggest a need to modify or create new coding variables related to concepts of system boundaries, externalities, cross-scale interactions, multi-functionality, and technological change. We suggest that such work needs provisioning if commons scholars are to navigate the continued challenges of tailoring frameworks and coding manuals to evolving CPR governance dilemmas.},

Infrastructure resources are the subject of many contentious public policy debates, including what to do about crumbling roads and bridges, whether and how to protect our natural environment, energy policy, even patent law reform, universal health care, network neutrality regulation, and the future of the Internet. Each of these involves a battle to control infrastructure resources, to establish the terms and conditions under which the public receives access, and to determine how the infrastructure and various dependent systems evolve over time. This book pays much needed attention to understanding how society benefits from infrastructure resources and how management decisions affect a wide variety of interests. The book links infrastructure, a particular set of resources defined in terms of the manner in which they create value, with commons, a resource management principle by which a resource is shared within a community. The infrastructure commons ideas have broad implications for scholarship and public policy across many fields ranging from traditional infrastructure like roads to environmental economics to intellectual property to Internet policy. Economics has become the methodology of choice for many scholars and policymakers in these areas. The book offers a rigorous economic challenge to the prevailing wisdom, which focuses primarily on problems associated with ensuring adequate supply. The book explores a set of questions: what drives the demand side of the equation, and how should demand-side drivers affect public policy? Demand for infrastructure resources involves a range of important considerations that bear on the optimal design of a regime for infrastructure management. The book identifies resource valuation and attendant management problems that recur across many different fields and many different resource types, and it develops a functional economic approach to understanding and analyzing these problems and potential solutions.},

Less is understood about how communities involved in such processes can attract top-down support without compromising their credibility or salience. We tested the usefulness of the linked boundary functions concept – boundary chains – for explaining the role of “research for development” (R4D) organizations in the integration of bottom-up community resource governance and top-down policy and legislative governance. We used the Australian Centre for Agricultural Research (ACIAR) in the Solomon Islands as a case study to probe the role of R4D organizations in this regard. The linked boundary functions concept proved useful in exploring the active functions of R4D organizations as actors that lend credibility, salience, and legitimacy to community-based governance initiatives. The concept of linked boundary functions or boundary chains can contribute to the current discussion in the complexity-aware theory of change and open new avenues for boundary management that enable the development of integrated resource governance in complex development contexts.

	abstract = {Common-pool resource theory (CPR theory) emerged to understand the limitations of the tragedy of the commons narrative, and the theory of human behavior underlying it. Over time, diverse critiques of CPR theory have also emerged. Prominent critiques include inattention to power and coercion, assumptions that institutions can be crafted, and analyses that exclude history and context, among others. We label this literature critical commons scholarship. In this review paper, we define a typology of five types of critical commons scholarship. The functionalist critique (type 1) argues that a narrow focus on institutions that excludes history, context, and contingencies causes erroneous conclusions about the causes of resource sustainability. The apolitical management critique (type 2) argues that a focus on resource sustainability causes commons scholars to ignore how power is used to create and maintain inequalities through rules and norms structuring resource access. The methodological critique (type 3) argues that methodological incompatibilities, such as CPR theory’s dependence on general, abstract models, necessarily prevent these scholars from responding to type 1 and type 2 critiques. The project of government critique (type 4) argues that common-pool resource theory is used to support neoliberal and hegemonic practices. Finally, the ethical critique (type 5) argues that common-pool resource theory is premised on problematic north-south relationships where expert scholars in the global north provide information to be consumed by “commoners” in the global south. Mainstream CPR theory has been limited in engaging with critical commons scholarship, but there are new tools (such as the social-ecological systems framework and the critical institutionalism approach) for addressing each type of critique. Our goal in developing this typology is to make critiques of CPR theory legible and potentially actionable, while acknowledging the challenges associated with addressing them.},

	abstract = {Scholarship on common-pool resource governance suggests that collective outcomes vary with the strength of the local arrangements for compliance monitoring. Following Elinor Ostrom's approach to question panaceas, we explore the possibility that there are multiple institutional designs can help sustain forests. We test this argument with data from a sample of 200 forest user groups in Bolivia and find broad empirical support for our propositions: Local monitoring can be an important predictor of forest governance performance, but focusing on monitoring alone can be misleading. Sometimes other aspects of the local governance system, such as self-organized rule making and sanctioning, are more important in explaining why some groups govern their forests more effectively than others. We also find that the more governance functions that communities decide to organize themselves, the more likely it is that local forests are sustained.},

We summarize the mechanisms by which inequality can lead to environmental degradation and their relevance for public health. We review the evidence of a relationship between environmental quality and social inequality along the axes of income, wealth, political power, and race and ethnicity. Our review suggests that the evidence is strongest for air- and water-quality measures that have more immediate health implications; evidence is less strong for more dispersed pollutants that have longer-term health impacts. More attention should be paid in research and in practice to links among inequality, the environment, and health, including more within-country studies that may elucidate causal pathways and points of intervention. We synthesize common metrics of inequality and methodological considerations in an effort to bring cohesion to such efforts.},

A major mechanism for this is housing, which is both a repository for wealth and, under these conditions, a magnifier of wealth.

We use comparative analysis of cases in Europe (London and Paris) and the United States (New York and San Francisco) to consider the capacities of different societies to limit or ameliorate these new sources of diverging opportunity. These seemingly local issues remain shaped by distinct national political contexts, which vary dramatically in their capacity to support local affordable housing and reduce the collective action problems confronting major metropolitan areas.},

	abstract = {The World Bank Group has two overarching goals: End extreme poverty by 2030 and promote shared prosperity by boosting the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of the population in each economy. As this year’s Poverty and Shared Prosperity report documents, the world continues to make progress toward these goals. In 2015, approximately one-tenth of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, and the incomes of the bottom 40 percent rose in 77 percent of economies studied. But success cannot be taken for granted. Poverty remains high in Sub- Saharan Africa, as well as in fragile and conflict-affected states. At the same time, most of the world’s poor now live in middle-income countries, which tend to have higher national poverty lines. This year’s report tracks poverty comparisons at two higher poverty thresholds—\$3.20 and \$5.50 per day—which are typical of standards in lower- and upper-middle-income countries. In addition, the report introduces a societal poverty line based on each economy’s median income or consumption. Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2018: Piecing Together the Poverty Puzzle also recognizes that poverty is not only about income and consumption—and it introduces a multidimensional poverty measure that adds other factors, such as access to education, electricity, drinking water, and sanitation. It also explores how inequality within households could affect the global profile of the poor. All these additional pieces enrich our understanding of the poverty puzzle, bringing us closer to solving it. For more information, please visit worldbank.org/PSP},

It starts by explaining some key terms in the inequality debate. It then examines recent trends and explains why income inequality varies between countries. Next it looks at why income gaps are growing and, in particular, at the rise of the 1\%. It then looks at the consequences, including research that suggests widening inequality could hurt economic growth. Finally, it examines policies for addressing inequality and making economies more inclusive.},

	abstract = {Current theoretical models of the commons assert that common-pool resources can only be managed sustainably with clearly defined boundaries around both communities and the resources that they use. In these theoretical models, open access inevitably leads to a tragedy of the commons. However, in many open-access systems, use of common-pool resources seems to be sustainable over the long term (i.e., current resource use does not threaten use of common-pool resources for future generations). Here, we outline the conditions that support sustainable resource use in open property regimes. We use the conceptual framework of complex adaptive systems to explain how processes within and couplings between human and natural systems can lead to the emergence of efficient, equitable, and sustainable resource use. We illustrate these dynamics in eight case studies of different social–ecological systems, including mobile pastoralism, marine and freshwater fisheries, swidden agriculture, and desert foraging. Our theoretical framework identifies eight conditions that are critical for the emergence of sustainable use of common-pool resources in open property regimes. In addition, we explain how changes in boundary conditions may push open property regimes to either common property regimes or a tragedy of the commons. Our theoretical model of emergent sustainability helps us to understand the diversity and dynamics of property regimes across a wide range of social–ecological systems and explains the enigma of open access without a tragedy. We recommend that policy interventions in such self-organizing systems should focus on managing the conditions that are critical for the emergence and persistence of sustainability.},

Argues that the relative convergence of self-interest and the public’s desire to improve the environment will determine when agreements will be most effective in addressing environmental problems; convergence of self-interest and the public’s desire to improve the environment produce greater potential for cooperation and effective agreements; diffusion of regulatory benefits while regulatory costs are concentrated on the few produce a high degree of regulatory instability and less potential for successful policy.

Positive actions are underway at multiple, smaller scales to start the process of climate change mitigation. Researchers need to understand the strength of polycentric systems where enterprises at multiple levels may complement each other. Building a global regime is a necessity, but encouraging the emergence of a polycentric system starts the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and acts as a spur to international regimes to do their part.},

Recent developments identify three strategies that make optimal use of current understanding in an environment of inevitable uncertainty and abrupt change: reducing the magnitude of, and exposure and sensitivity to, known stresses; focusing on proactive policies that shape change; and avoiding or escaping unsustainable social–ecological traps. As we discuss here, all social–ecological systems are vulnerable to recent and projected changes but have sources of adaptive capacity and resilience that can sustain ecosystem services and human well-being through active ecosystem stewardship.

	abstract = {Despite the recognition that institutions matter for international development, the debates over institutional reforms tend to obscure the role of power. Neoliberal models of development are often promoted in terms of their technical merits and efficiency gains and rarely account for the multiple ways that social, economic and political power shape institutional design and institutional change. Even recent efforts to address power tend to conceptualize it too narrowly. This special issue seeks to rethink the role of power in institutional creation and change in the context of persistent neoliberalism. In the introduction, we synthesize the literature on the nature of power to develop a new conceptual framework – a power in institutions matrix – that highlights the multiple dimensions of power involved in institutional development and change. We argue that such a theoretically-informed mapping of power in institutions will enable scholars, practitioners, and citizen groups to go beyond the standard critiques in order to analyze the multifaceted effects of neoliberal institutional change. Our introduction draws on an extensive literature review as well as the special issue contributors who examine institutional change in a variety of policy sectors in Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North America. We find that a range of diverse local, national and transnational actors, with disparate access to power, negotiate institutional changes from above and below through overt imposition of and resistance to new rules, influence of agendas, and promotion of discourses. Neoliberalism thus creates a new distributive politics. The special issue thus offers a theoretically-grounded approach for linking international and domestic power differences to the process of institutional change, with a specific focus on equity and sustainability. In a departure from the current literature’s focus on elite bargains, we showcase the efforts by less powerful groups to gain a foothold in decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {This perspective discusses nine conditions for enhancing the performance of multistakeholder partnerships for sustainable development. Such partnerships have become mainstream implementation mechanisms for attaining international sustainable development goals and are also frequently used in other adjacent policy domains such as climate change, health and biodiversity. While multistakeholder arrangements are widely perceived as a positive contribution to addressing global change, few studies have systematically evaluated the existing evidence for their positive performance. This poses an urgent and important challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand and improve the effectiveness of partnerships, in particular since their popularity increases despite their past track record. The recommendations presented are based on own research, a literature survey and discussions with a large number or international Civil Society Organizations at two occasions during 2014. This article proceeds as follows: first, we define multistakeholder partnerships, outline their rational and summarize available assessments on partnership success; second, we provide a set of concrete recommendations based on lessons-learned from over 10 years of scholarship; and third, we conclude with some reflections on the future of multistakeholder governance for sustainability.},

By presenting a new and original data set and by presenting original essays by renowned scholars, this book lays the foundation for what will become an increasingly important focus for both economic development and international relations as well as for their intersection. The volume contains four parts. The first introduces the core issues and concepts that are explored throughout the book as well as a new and original data set on RPGs. The second part further develops specific concepts important for understanding 21st-century RPGs: regional leadership, alliances, networks, and outcomes. The third examines how cooperation takes place worldwide for a range of important RPGs. Finally, the fourth part discusses how public goods are produced in specific regions, stressing that each region has a distinct context and that these contexts overlap in a decentered "multiplex" manner. Global economic cooperation will be different in the 21st century, and this volume will be of interest to students and scholars of global governance, economic development, international political economy, sustainable development, and comparative regionalism."--Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {As the world becomes increasingly globalized, the need for governments to continually cooperate structures has become irreversible. This book looks critically at global governance structures in the economic and social field in order to understand what has been done and what can be done better. A close look at the United Nations (UN)’s relationship with development cooperation and global public goods, as well as its infrastructure and potential biases, gives a thorough understanding of the current status of the world’s premier global governance structure. Additionally, analyses of official development assistance, multilateral development banks, and infrastructure financing cast a wider net to demonstrate the growing need for global cooperation and development beyond the borders of the UN. These seven chapters by nearly a dozen authors have been written at a pivotal moment in global governance initiatives, when the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda is drawing international development into a new era. As this new agenda shifts the future of global development initiatives and increasingly relies on civil society, non-state actors, and regional and local governments to fulfill the sustainable development goals, how will international cooperation and development institutions be changed? And how can we make sure that these initiatives and institutions are innovating for the better?

	abstract = {This chapter therefore pursues a twofold objective. The first section identifies the major discrepancies that have arisen between the theory and reality of public goods. The discussion shows that the conventional
concept now covers but a part, perhaps even a shrinking part, of the total reality of public goods. It focuses on national public goods and on
the state ’ s role in providing these goods. Largely excluded from the analysis are issues pertaining to transnational — regional and global —
public goods, international cooperation in support of these goods, as well as aspects of voluntary and private provision.

Against this background the second section of the chapter suggests possible conceptual modifications that would be important for a fuller understanding of global public goods (GPGs) and their provision. The main conclusion emerging from the analysis in this chapter is
that for the provision of a particular public good to be considered adequate, at a given point in time, it is important to match the circle
of stakeholders (those affected by the good ’ s benefits or costs) with the circle of decision makers. In other words, where publicness in consumption is matched by publicness in decision making the resultant provision
of the good is likely also to generate publicness in utility , that is, a distribution of net benefits that concerned stakeholders perceive as
adequate — relatively efficient, effective, fair, and, therefore, also legitimate.},

I examine three interdependent sets of concerns: (a) intersectionality as a field of study that is situated within the power relations that it studies; (b) intersectionality as an analytical strategy that provides new angles of vision on social phenomena; and (c) intersectionality as critical praxis that informs social justice projects.},

	abstract = {This chapter aims to address this gap through an inductive, data-driven approach to analyzing RPGs. We present an original data set, based on the UN Treaty Collection series, which allows us to systematically measure a particular mode of RPG provision: cooperation among national governments to produce RPGs. In defining such cooperation, we exclude ODA;3 while ODA can also promote RPGs, we are interested here (for reasons later explained) in the efforts of states to provide RPGs through cooperative arrangements rather than the provision of bilateral or multilateral aid.
This approach enables us to map the existing ecosystem of RPG cooperation and observe patterns across space, time, and types of public goods. Through this exercise, we can gain empirical traction on the core conceptual questions that befuddle discussions of RPGs: what are the relevant boundaries of “regions”? How do these differ for different public goods? Which public goods should be properly thought of as “regional”?
These questions are not merely of academic interest. RPGs are increasingly important to the prospects of developing economies, but the conceptual and empirical challenges previously discussed prevent us from drawing systematic conclusions about their effectiveness. While this data set does not measure the coverage, quality, or impact of actual public goods provision, knowing which groups of countries are cooperating to produce which public goods is an important step toward doing so.},

Within this framework we compare observations of GIPs from three domains – empirical reality, theory, and policy – to better understand their function as an incentive mechanism for encouraging new solutions to large-scale social challenges. Combining data from direct observation, personal interviews, and surveys, together with analysis of extant theory and policy documents on GIPs, our results highlight three points of divergence: first, over the complexity of defining prize specifications; secondly, over the nature and role of incentives, particularly patents; thirdly, the overlooked challenges associated with prize governance. Our approach identifies a clear roadmap for future theory and policy around GIPs.},

This is in stark contrast with mainstream economics of innovation theories where prizes and patents are substitute ways to generate revenue and encourage innovation. Building on the management of innovation literature which stresses the difficulty to specify ex-ante all the technical features of the winning technologies, we develop a model in which innovative effort is multi-dimensional and only a subset of innovation tasks can be measured and contracted upon. We show that in this environment patent rights and cash rewards are complements, and that GIPs are often preferable to patent races or prizes requiring technologies to be placed in the public domain. Moreover, our model uncovers a tendency for patent races to encourage speed of discovery over quality of innovation, which can be corrected by GIPs. We explore robustness to endogenous entry, costly public funds, and incomplete information by GIP organizers on the surplus created by the technology.},

We draw the lessons from both practical experience in diverse contexts around the world and from scholarly advances in understanding the relationships between science and society. Many of these lessons will be familiar to those with experience in crafting knowledge to support action for sustainable development. However, few are included in the formal training of researchers. As a result, when scientists and engineers first venture out of the laboratory or library with the goal of linking their knowledge with action, the outcome has often been ineffectiveness and disillusionment. We therefore articulate here a core set of lessons that we believe should become part of the basic training for researchers interested in crafting usable knowledge for sustainable development. These lessons entail at least four things researchers should know, and four things they should do. The knowing lessons involve understanding the coproduction relationships through which knowledge making and decision making shape one another in social–environmental systems. We highlight the lessons that emerge from examining those coproduction relationships through the ICAP lens, viewing them from the perspectives of Innovation systems, Complex systems, Adaptive systems, and Political systems. The doing lessons involve improving the capacity of the research community to put its understanding of coproduction into practice. We highlight steps through which researchers can help build capacities for stakeholder collaboration, social learning, knowledge governance, and researcher training.},

	abstract = {The exercise of power permeates global governance processes, making power a critical concept for understanding, explaining, and influencing the intersection of global governance and health. This article briefly presents and discusses three well-established conceptualizations of power—Dahl’s, Bourdieu’s, and Barnett and Duvall’s—from different disciplines, finding that each is important for understanding global governance but none is sufficient. The conceptualization of power itself needs to be expanded to include the multiple ways in which one actor can influence the thinking or actions of others. I further argue that global governance processes exhibit features of complex adaptive systems, the analysis of which requires taking into account multiple types of power. Building on established frameworks, the article then offers an expanded typology of eight kinds of power: physical, economic, structural, institutional, moral, discursive, expert, and network. The typology is derived from and illustrated by examples from global health, but may be applicable to global governance more broadly. Finally, one seemingly contradictory – and cautiously optimistic – conclusion emerges from this typology: multiple types of power can mutually reinforce tremendous power disparities in global health; but at the same time, such disparities are not necessarily absolute or immutable. Further research on the complex interaction of multiple types of power is needed for a better understanding of global governance and health.},

In this special feature we draw on experiences from around the world to demonstrate and investigate the consequences of diverse capacities and capabilities in bringing science and governance together. We propose the concept of coproductive capacities as a useful new lens through which to examine these relations. Coproductive capacity is the combination of scientific resources and governance capability that shapes the extent to which a society, at various levels, can operationalize relationships between scientific and public, private, and civil society institutions and actors to effect scientifically-informed social change. This recasts the relationships between science and society from notions of gaps to notions of interconnectedness and interplay (coproduction); alongside the societal foundations that shape what is or is not possible in that dynamic connection (capacities). The articles in this special feature apply this concept to reveal social, political, and institutional conditions that both support and inhibit high-quality environmental governance as global issues are tackled in particular places. Across these articles we suggest that five themes emerge as important to understanding coproductive capacity: history, experience, and perceptions; quality of relationships (especially in suboptimal settings); disjunct across scales; power, interests, and legitimacy; and alternative pathways for environmental governance. Taking a coproductive capacities perspective can help us identify which interventions may best enable scientifically informed, but locally sensitive approaches to environmental governance.},

For decades, scientists have been raising calls for societal changes that will reduce our impacts on nature. Though much conservation has occurred, our natural environment continues to decline under the weight of our consumption. Humanity depends directly on the output of nature; thus, this decline will affect us, just as it does the other species with which we share this world. Díaz et al. review the findings of the largest assessment of the state of nature conducted as of yet. They report that the state of nature, and the state of the equitable distribution of nature's support, is in serious decline. Only immediate transformation of global business-as-usual economies and operations will sustain nature as we know it, and us, into the future.
Science, this issue p. eaax3100
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDHuman actions have long been known to drive declines in nature, and there is growing awareness of how globalization means that these drivers increasingly act at a distance (telecoupling). However, evidence from different disciplines has largely accumulated in parallel, and the global effects of telecouplings have never been addressed comprehensively. Now, the first integrated global-scale intergovernmental assessment of the status, trends, and future of the links between people and nature provides an unprecedented picture of the extent of our mutual dependence, the breadth and depth of the ongoing and impending crisis, and the interconnectedness among sectors and regions.
ADVANCESHuman impacts on life on Earth have increased sharply since the 1970s. The world is increasingly managed to maximize the flow of material contributions from nature to keep up with rising demands for food, energy, timber, and more, with global trade increasing the geographic separation between supply and demand. This unparalleled appropriation of nature is causing the fabric of life on which humanity depends to fray and unravel: Most indicators of the state of nature, whether monitored by natural and social scientists or by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are declining. These include the number and population size of wild species, the number of local varieties of domesticated species, the distinctness of ecological communities, and the extent and integrity of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. As a consequence, nature’s capacity to provide crucial benefits has also declined, including environmental processes underpinning human health and nonmaterial contributions to human quality of life. The costs are distributed unequally, as are the benefits of an expanding global economy.These trends in nature and its contributions to people are projected to worsen in the coming decades—unevenly so among different regions—unless rapid and integrated action is taken to reduce the direct drivers responsible for most change over the past 50 years: land and sea use change, direct harvesting of many plants and animals, climate change (whose impacts are set to accelerate), pollution, and the spread of invasive alien species. Exploratory scenarios suggest that a world with increased regional barriers—resonating with recent geopolitical trends—will yield more negative global trends in nature, as well as the greatest disparity in trends across regions, greater than a world with liberal financial markets, and much greater than one that prioritizes and integrates actions toward sustainable development. Evidence from target-seeking scenarios and pathways indicates that a world that achieves many of the global biodiversity targets and sustainability goals related to food, energy, climate, and water is not—yet—beyond reach, but that no single action can get us there.
OUTLOOKOur comprehensive assessment of status, trends, and possible futures for nature and people suggests that action at the level of direct drivers of nature decline, although necessary, is not sufficient to prevent further deterioration of the fabric of life on Earth. Reversal of recent declines—and a sustainable global future—are only possible with urgent transformative change that tackles the root causes: the interconnected economic, sociocultural, demographic, political, institutional, and technological indirect drivers behind the direct drivers. As well as a pan-sectoral approach to conserving and restoring the nature that underpins many goals, this transformation will need innovative governance approaches that are adaptive; inclusive; informed by existing and new evidence; and integrative across systems, jurisdictions, and tools. Although the challenge is formidable, every delay will make the task even harder. Crucially, our analysis pinpoints five priority interventions (“levers”) and eight leverage points for intervention in the indirect drivers of global social and economic systems where they can make the biggest difference. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/sci/366/6471/eaax3100/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Traditional diversity-rich human landscapes, and the livelihoods and identities that depend on them, face global threats.Mosaics of crops, forest, and pasture have been maintained for millennia around the world.

So are the livelihoods and cultural identity of the peoples that live in them, such as this woman collecting fodder for her flock in the Checacupe district, Perú.Photo credit www.estebantapella.com
The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s, driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature’s benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend—nature and its contributions to people—is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic, social, and technological causes of nature’s deterioration.},

Recognizing the complexity of the science, the decisions, and the communication processes, the report calls for a systems approach. This perspective offers an approach to creating such systems by adapting scientific methods to the practical constraints of science communication. It considers staffing (are the right people involved?), internal collaboration (are they talking to one another?), and external collaboration (are they talking to other stakeholders?). It focuses on contexts where the goal of science communication is helping people to make autonomous choices rather than promoting specific behaviors (e.g., voter turnout, vaccination rates, energy consumption). The approach is illustrated with research in two domains: decisions about preventing sexual assault and responding to pandemic disease.},

“Science Advice and Global Environmental Governance takes the reader behind the scenes of multilateral environmental agreements on ozone, chemicals and desertification, and into the advisory committees where the actions of experts and scientists help shape treaty implementation.

“Science Advice and Global Environmental Governance” examines expert committees established to provide science advice to multilateral environmental agreements. By focusing on how these institutions are sites of coproduction of knowledge and policy, this work brings to light the politics of science advice and details how these committees are contributing to an emerging global environmental constitutionalism.
Grounded in participant observation, elite interviews and document analysis, “Science Advice and Global Environmental Governance” uses the lenses of the body of experts, body of knowledge, and institutional body to focus on three features of design. Who are the experts being asked to provide advice? What types of knowledge are considered beyond the bounds of the committee and how is this determined? What rules and norms are developed to govern how the committee carries out its work?
The empirical chapters lay out three illustrations: controversy over the continued use of methyl bromide despite it being scheduled for a ban under the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, a series of votes by the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Review Committee when determining whether the pesticide endosulfan should be banned under the Stockholm Convention on POPs and a decade of institutional innovation in an effort to revamp the provision of science advice to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.}

	abstract = {This report is an independent scientific review of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) and 169 targets, as submitted to the UN General Assembly by the UN Open Working Group (OWG). It is a unique tool designed primarily for negotiators, technical support
teams and other actors engaged in defining a universal, integrated and transformational
set of global goals and targets for sustainable development and the political declaration
on the post-2015 development Agenda. In particular it is a resource for technical review
of the targets carried out in preparation for their adoption and translation at the national
level. With more than 40 contributing authors from 21 countries, the report brings
together a wide range of scientific expertise across the natural and social sciences in an
accessible and concise manner.
The report offers rigorous analysis of the proposed goals and targets, collectively and
individually, assessing whether they are backed up by scientific evidence, whether they
address the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development
in an integrated way, and whether they are sufficiently specific to be effectively implemented and monitored.  It clearly identifies how well defined each target is through a
“traffic light” colour scheme (green, amber, red), signaling where more technical work
may be needed. Concrete recommendations are put forward for consideration in refining
the goals and targets or in planning for their implementation.

This report by the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Social Science Council (ISSC) finds that of the 169 targets beneath the 17 draft goals, just 29\% are well defined and based on the latest scientific evidence, while 54\% need more work and 17\% are weak or non-essential.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about environmental problems has expanded rapidly in recent decades, as have the number and variety of processes for making large-scale scientific assessments of those problems and their possible solutions. Yet too often scientific information has not been transformed into effective and appropriate policies to protect the global environment. In this book, scholars use a comparative analytic framework and supporting case studies to evaluate the impact of environmental assessments, looking at how, and under what conditions, global environmental assessments influence political and economic decision makers. They find that global environmental assessments are more likely to be influential if the process is perceived not only as scientifically credible but also as salient to policy concerns and as generated through legitimate means. The studies show that although the content of the assessment clearly matters, its influence is often determined more by the process that generated it and by external factors affecting the receptiveness of different audiences. Assessments that involve ongoing interactions among scientists, stakeholders, and policymakers prove particularly likely to influence behaviors.

The diverse case studies—ranging from global assessments of climate change and acid precipitation to assessments of sea-level rise in Maine and Hawai'i and climate forecasting in Zimbabwe—embed their findings in contemporary theoretical frameworks while remaining informed by pragmatic policy considerations.},

This article seeks to advance understandings of violence against environmental and community activists challenging authoritarian forms of environmental and resource governance through eco-populist struggles. Authoritarianism and populism entertain complex relationships, including authoritarian practices toward and within eco-populist movements. Examining a major agrarian conflict and the killing of a prominent Indigenous leader in Honduras, we point to the frequent occurrence of deadly repression within societies experiencing high levels of inequalities, historical marginalization of Indigenous and peasant communities, a liberalization of foreign and private investments in land-based sectors, and recent reversals in partial democratization processes taking place within a broader context of high homicidal violence and impunity rates. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of deadly repression on environmental and land defenders. Key words: authoritarianism, environmental defenders, Honduras, populism, repression.},

Goal 4 promotes quality education and Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However, creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require individuals to acquire ‘key competencies’, aligning with notions of transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context specific competencies.},

Findings in the areas of both competencies and pedagogies for sustainability education imply the benefits of integrative, active, collaborative, and applied approaches to curriculum development and teaching—approaches that directly involve students in learning and practicing transdisciplinary engagement in service to sustainability. The Bachelor of Arts in Sustainability Studies program at Colorado Mountain College serves as an example of how the articulated competency framework is being applied to evaluate and enhance curriculum and learning outcomes. The competency framework and pedagogical recommendations offered may also serve as roadmaps for educators at other institutions who prepare graduates to address the pressing challenges of sustainability evident in communities, nations, and the world.},

Rather than treating culture as a social sphere separate from politics and the economy, we conceptualize it as the ideas, values, and assumptions underpinning policies and practices in all spheres. We review recent research on movements’ impacts on public opinion and everyday behavior; the media and popular culture; nonpolitical institutions such as science, medicine, and education; and politics. We focus on cultural impacts that have mattered for movements’ constituencies and address why movements have had those impacts. We conclude with an agenda for future research, seeking greater connection between the literatures on movements and the literatures on the institutions that matter to movements.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the socio-technical imaginaries surrounding infrastructures of coal mining and coal combustion in Poland. Contemporary policy makers in Poland mobilise a national imaginary inherited from communist times – encapsulated in the slogan ‘Poland stands on coal’ – that fuses infrastructures of coal extraction and combustion with the fate of the nation. This socio-technical imaginary provides support for coal futures, even in the face of contradictory evidence for domestic resource depletion, poor regional air quality, and global climate change. To examine this process, the paper brings research on socio-technical imaginaries into conversation with work on resource materialities. It highlights how certain materialities of coal (abundance, accessibility, energy density, location) were integral to the emergence of a national socio-technical imaginary of modernisation via coal; and how other materialities (declining resource quality, effects of emissions on respiratory health, coal as CO2-in-waiting) now collide with the political strategies of a government determined to reassert ‘black gold’ as a bedrock of national development for years to come. The paper considers how contemporary political efforts to rehabilitate coal and secure its future in Poland draw selectively upon a socio-technical imaginary of coal-fuelled national modernisation.},

	abstract = {Mobilizations occurring around just transitions and design for transition contain many potential points of overlap. They are presently remarkably disengaged. This article seeks to rectify this situation by offering some preliminary notes on how convergences between these currents might facilitate modes of anti-racist, feminist and ecosocialist design futuring that can get us to think beyond degrowth/Left ecomodern binaries and toward a design politics that can support a Green New Deal. I proceed by mapping the evolution of labor-focused just transition discussions and indicate how feminist, climate justice and decolonial contributions have expanded and complicated understandings of the labors of transition. I then go on to suggest how such currents could productively engage further with the emerging field of design for transition. Design is not to be trusted. However, post-carbon futures are not simply going to emerge through protest and policy shifts alone. Just transitions will have to be imagined and built, fabricated and realized, coded and created. This will involve the channeling of enormous amounts of creative labor and inventive praxis. It will also involve the construction of public spaces and public institutions where new knowledge practices can meet. Bringing radical traditions of design, invention and innovation into dialogue with movements pushing for just transitions could make significant contributions to achieving this end.},

The conflict, with mainly economists on one side and ecologists and philosophers on the other, has centered on the difference between “strong” and “weak” sustainability. Weak sustainability requires only the protection of wealth across generations, while strong sustainability requires also the protection of ecophysical features of the environment. It is shown that weak sustainability, and solutions meant to achieve it, when applied to the parable of the tragedy of the commons, cannot protect resources whether owned or held in common. A communitarian approach, joined with an idea of communities as multigenerational entities and a commitment to a deliberative process seeking sustainability, can track a path toward strong sustainability.},

We test our hypotheses using a novel panel data set of 4,750 public companies across many industries that are headquartered in 45 countries during 2004–2007. Results show that firms that are more environmentally damaging, particularly those in countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and global norms, are less likely to engage in selective disclosure.

Yet, the most common drivers were awareness, education, and knowledge sharing; and (d) regardless of whether state-centric or decentralized governance was preferred, personal action was seen as essential. The focus groups displayed a shared understanding across the geographical settings; a common realization of profound sustainability predicaments facing societies across the world; and a desire for fundamental change towards a more sustainable way of life.},

	abstract = {This study develops research on social movements, political coalitions, and sustainability transitions with a multi-coalition perspective. The perspective begins with a typology of coalitions based on two pairs of goals—general societal change versus the sociotechnical transition of an industry or technological system, and sunrising versus sunsetting of systems and structures. Mapping the diversity of energy-transition coalitions makes it possible not only to identify the various wings of a broader industrial transition movement in a specified time and place but also to show the dynamics of how coalitions interact and change over time. Drawing on case studies of four energy-transition coalitions in New York State that approximate the four ideal types, the study shows differences in the goals, strategies, organizational composition, and frames of the coalitions. The study then shows the mechanisms that enable integration across coalitions, including the role of bridge brokers and new frames. As the networks of the energy-transition coalitions become more connected, the organizations make use of a wider set of frames, including the newer frame of energy democracy. Thus, the study develops an approach to the study of energy democracy that shows how it can serve as a frame that bridge brokers use to integrate coalitions.},

One of the main objectives of the study is to make an argument that the Marxian and Gramscian ideas of false consciousness and hegemony are incorrect. He develops this conclusion throughout the book, through the different scenarios and characters that come up during his time of fieldwork in the village. This publication, based on 2 years of fieldwork (1978-1980), focuses on the local class relations in a small rice farming community of 70 households in the main paddy-growing area of Kedah in Malaysia. Introduction of the Green Revolution in 1976 eliminated 2/3 of the wage-earning opportunities for smallholders and landless laborers. The main ensuing class struggle is analyzed being the ideological struggle in the village and the practice of resistance itself consisting of: foot-dragging, dissimulation, desertion, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance and sabotage acts. Rich and poor are engaged in an unremitting if silent struggle to define changes in land tenure, mechanization and employment to advance their own interests, and to use values that they share to control the distribution of status, land, work and grain.},

The culmination of a half century of engagement with population ethics, Partha Dasgupta's masterful Time and the Generations blends economics, philosophy, and ecology to offer an original lens on the difficult topic of optimum global population.After offering careful attention to global inequality and the imbalance of power between men and women, Dasgupta provides tentative answers to two fundamental questions: What level of economic activity can our planet support over the long run, and what does the answer say about optimum population numbers? He develops a population ethics that can be used to evaluate our choices and guide our sense of a sustainable global population and living standards. Structured around a central essay from Dasgupta, the book also features a foreword from Robert Solow; correspondence with Kenneth Arrow; incisive commentaries from Joseph Stiglitz, Eric Maskin, and Scott Barrett; an extended response by the author to them; and a joint paper with Aisha Dasgupta on inequalities in reproductive decisions and the idea of reproductive rights.

The Global Chemicals Outlook II – From Legacies to Innovative Solutions: Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, mandated by the UN Environment Assembly in 2016, seeks to alert policymakers and other stakeholders to the critical role of the sound management of chemicals and waste in sustainable development. It takes stock of global trends as well as progress made and gaps in achieving the global goal to minimize the adverse impacts from chemicals and waste by 2020.



The full Global Chemicals Outlook II was launched electronically on 29 April 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, at a side event at the meetings of the conferences of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions. The Synthesis Report was launched on 11 March 2019 at the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly. A shorter Summary for Policymakers was tabled as working document of the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly and is available in all six UN languages.

The Global Chemicals Outlook II finds that the global goal to minimize adverse impacts of chemicals and waste will not be achieved by 2020. Solutions exist, but more ambitious worldwide action by all stakeholders is urgently required.

The Global Chemicals Outlook II consists of the following parts:


	Introduction and key messages for policymakers
	Part I: The evolving chemicals economy: status and trends relevant for sustainability
	Part II: Where do we stand in achieving the 2020 goal – assessing overall progress and gaps
	Part III. Advancing and Sharing Chemicals Management Tools and Approaches: Taking Stock, Looking into the Future
	Part IV: Enabling policies and action to support innovative solutions
	Part V: Scaling up collaborative action under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
	Index


Process and mandate for the Global Chemicals Outlook II

The Global Chemicals Outlook II has been prepared over the past three years through a process involving more than 400 scientists and experts around the world under the guidance of the Steering Committee of the Global Chemicals Outlook II with participation from all regions and a wide range of stakeholders. The report has been developed in response to Governing Council decision 27/12, adopted in 2013, and United Nations Environment Assembly resolution 2/7, adopted in 2016.

The first edition of the Global Chemicals Outlook

The Global Chemicals Outlook: Towards Sound Management of Chemicals was published in February 2013 and assembled scientific, technical and socio-economic information on the sound management of chemicals.

It covered trends and indicators for chemical production, transport, use and disposal, and associated health and environmental impacts; economic implications of these trends, including costs of inaction and benefits of action; and instruments and approaches for sound management of chemicals. Decision 27/12, adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme in 2013, recognized the significance of the findings of the Global Chemicals Outlook.

Strands of interdependence are weaving humanity and Earth into a single community of fate—the overarching proto-country herein christened Earthland. In the unsettled twenty-first century, the drama of social evolution will play out on a world stage with the perils many and dark premonitions all too plausible.

Still, a Great Transition to a planetary civilization of enriched lives and a healthy planet remains possible. But how? What forms of collective action and consciousness can redirect us toward such a future? Who will lead the charge? What might such a world look like?

Journey to Earthland offers answers. It clarifies the world-historical challenge; explains the critical role of a global citizens movement in advancing social transformation; and paints a picture of the kind of flourishing civilization that might lie on the other side of a Great Transition.

In this pivotal moment, the odyssey to a different world is underway yet the ultimate destination depends on choices and struggles yet to come. Acting to prevent the futures we dread is where our work must begin. But the larger task is to foster the finer Earthland we and our descendants deserve.},

Ecological changes pose special challenges for long-term thinking, because of the possibility of regime shifts that occur rapidly yet alter the availability of ecosystem services for generations. Moreover, ecological feedbacks can intensify human modification of ecosystems, creating a spiral of poverty and ecosystem degradation. Such complex dynamics were evaluated by a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analyses in the MA scenarios. Collectively, the scenarios explore problems such as the connections of poverty reduction and ecosystem services, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. Several promising approaches are considered by the scenarios, including uses of biodiversity to build resilience of ecosystem services, actively adaptive management, and green technology. Although the scenarios do not prescribe an optimal path, they illuminate the consequences of different policies toward ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Citizen participation in decision-making has been widely lauded as a method for improving outcomes in
environmental management, international development, democratic governance, and sustainability
science, among other areas. While there are normative reasons to encourage more inclusive decisionmaking processes, costly and time-intensive group decision-making processes are often justified on the
grounds that they may also improve outcomes. Deliberative discussion, in particular, is believed to be
more transformative than a mere aggregation of individual preferences. Empirical work confirms that
deliberation results in shifts of opinion, but it has had little to say about the quality of the resulting
decisions, which are understandably difficult to assess in a field setting. This research involves controlled
laboratory experiments conducted in Nairobi, and it examines the hypothesis that deliberative discussion
leads to better (more socially optimal) collective decision-making. I find that participation in group
decision-making involving deliberation (but not a simple majority vote) does result in more successful
collective outcomes. This effect is not achieved through greater effort exerted, but rather through better
strategic decision making that minimizes the costs associated with contributions. Deliberation is also
associated with changes in preferences, greater levels of agreement with decision outcomes, and greater
perceived fairness. This research sheds some light on the relationship between deliberative democracy and
collective decision making.},

New research has explained how migration systems interact with environmental challenges in individual decisions and in globally aggregate flows.

Because forest transitions can increase biodiversity and augment carbon sequestration, they appeal to policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss and climate change. What then can policymakers do to trigger forest transitions? The historical record over the last two centuries provides insights into the precipitating conditions. The early transitions often occurred passively, through the spontaneous regeneration of trees on abandoned agricultural lands. Later forest transitions occurred more frequently after large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred governments to take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped lands. To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with clearly articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover. These historical shifts in forest transitions reflect our growing appreciation of their utility for countering droughts, floods, land degradation, and climate change.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the recent literature on the dynamics of global wealth inequality. I first reconcile available estimates of wealth inequality in the United States. Both surveys and tax data show that wealth inequality has increased dramatically since the 1980s, with a top 1\% wealth share of approximately 40\% in 2016 versus 25–30\% in the 1980s. Second, I discuss the fast-growing literature on wealth inequality across the world. Evidence points toward a rise in global wealth concentration: For China, Europe, and the United States combined, the top 1\% wealth share has increased from 28\% in 1980 to 33\% today, while the bottom 75\% share hovered around 10\%. Recent studies, however, may underestimate the level and rise of inequality, as financial globalization makes it increasingly hard to measure wealth at the top. I discuss how new data sources (leaks from financial institutions, tax amnesties, and macroeconomic statistics of tax havens) can be leveraged to better capture the wealth of the rich.},

	abstract = {Climate change is altering the productivity of natural resources with far-reaching implications for those who depend on them. Resource-dependent industries and communities need the capacity to adapt to a range of climate risks if they are to remain viable. In some instances, the scale and nature of the likely impacts means that transformations of function or structure will be required. Transformations represent a switch to a distinct new system where a different suite of factors become important in the design and implementation of response strategies. There is a critical gap in knowledge on understanding transformational capacity and its influences. On the basis of current knowledge on adaptive capacity we propose four foundations for measuring transformational capacity: (1) how risks and uncertainty are managed, (2) the extent of skills in planning, learning and reorganizing, (3) the level of financial and psychological flexibility to undertake change and (4) the willingness to undertake change. We test the influence of place attachment and occupational identity on transformational capacity using the Australian peanut industry, which is presently assessing significant structural change in response to predicted climatic changes. Survey data from 88\% of peanut farmers in Queensland show a strong negative correlation between transformational capacity and both place attachment and occupational attachment, suggesting that whilst these factors may be important positive influences on the capacity to adapt to incremental change, they act as barriers to transformational change.},

	abstract = {A growing scholarship on multistakeholder learning dialogues suggests the importance of closely managing learning processes to help stakeholders anticipate which policies are likely to be effective. Much less work has focused on how to manage effective transnational multistakeholder learning dialogues, many of which aim to help address critical global environmental and social problems such as climate change or biodiversity loss. They face three central challenges. First, they rarely shape policies and behaviors directly, but work to ‘nudge’ or ‘tip the scales’ in domestic settings. Second, they run the risk of generating ‘compromise’ approaches incapable of ameliorating the original problem definition for which the dialogue was created. Third, they run the risk of being overly influenced, or captured, by powerful interests whose rationale for participating is to shift problem definitions or narrow instrument choices to those innocuous to their organizational or individual interests. Drawing on policy learning scholarship, we identify a six-stage learning process for anticipating effectiveness designed to minimize these risks while simultaneously fostering innovative approaches for meaningful and longlasting problem solving: Problem definition assessments; Problem framing; Developing coalition membership; Causal framework development; Scoping exercises; Knowledge institutionalization. We also identify six management techniques within each process for engaging transnational dialogues around problem solving. We show that doing so almost always requires anticipating multiple-step causal pathways through which influence of transnational and/or international actors and institutions might occur.},

	abstract = {Can norms of distributive fairness serve as pillars of a new and more effective global climate regime? Three general principles – responsibilities, capabilities (capacity), and needs (or rights) – are frequently invoked and rarely disputed. Yet, parties’ interpretations often diverge, reflecting conflicts of interests. To determine how much is at stake, we compare – by means of a global integrated assessment model (GRACE) – 15 legitimate interpretations of ‘responsibilities’ and ‘capabilities’ in terms of their implications for the mitigation obligations and costs of seven potentially pivotal actors. Most of these interpretations yield similar results for most actors. In a scenario where global emissions in 2030 are reduced by 20\% compared to a business-as-usual baseline, mitigation costs vary by less than 1\% of GDP for the United States, the European Union, Japan, India, and China. For Brazil and Russia, however, variance is much larger. Moreover, for all actors, mitigation costs rise steeply as ambition levels increase. Under such circumstances, searching for a single ‘fairness-optimizing’ formula is likely to fail. As negotiators explore systems of voluntary pledges, a more promising approach would conceive of fairness as a multidimensional construct and foster accommodation through mutual recognition of a limited range of legitimate norm interpretations.},

Although some of the parameters of the problem are ethical and outside the scope of economic analysis, we claim that there are converging and convincing arguments in favor of using an annual real risk-free discount rate going from approximately 4\% to approximately 1\% for maturities going from zero to infinity. Investing in climate mitigation yields highly uncertain future benefits. Such uncertainty should also be taken into account in the selection of the discount rate, although the appropriate approach is highly controversial.},

Examining clean energy laws in Texas, Kansas, Arizona, and Ohio over a thirty-year time frame, Stokes argues that organized combat between advocate and opponent interest groups is central to explaining why states are not on track to address the climate crisis. She tells the political history of our energy institutions, explaining how fossil fuel companies and electric utilities have promoted climate denial and delay. Stokes further explains the limits of policy feedback theory, showing the ways that interest groups drive retrenchment through lobbying, public opinion, political parties and the courts. More than a history of renewable energy policy in modern America, Short Circuiting Policy offers a bold new argument about how the policy process works, and why seeming victories can turn into losses when the opposition has enough resources to roll back laws.},

Its proponents claim to provide a new instrument to facilitate the formulation of effective and evidence-based policy, taking people’s actual behaviour into account from the outset, while preserving their liberty to choose. This article reviews the origins of libertarian paternalism and the behavioural insights it builds on and takes a critical look at the foundations nudging relies on as a policy tool. It also discusses the ongoing efforts to build policy capacity to integrate behavioural insights and experimental methods in the creation of public policy. Behavioural insights offer a powerful tool to reshape and design new evidence-based policy.

This paper takes issue with this claim. Policy advice, it is argued, needs to be anchored in the accumulated research on the issue at hand, in this case, innovation. The paper therefore starts by distilling some important insights on innovation from the accumulated research on this topic and, with this in mind, considers various policy approaches that have been suggested for influencing innovation and sustainability transitions. Finally, the lessons for the development and implementation of transformative innovation policy are considered.

Drawing on extensive interview data from a U.K. bio-manufacturing company, the empirical analysis shows how such narratives emerge by constructing a web of related, self-reinforcing narratives reflecting a consistent theme. The analysis demonstrates how the dominant (success) narrative remains vivid despite the existence of deviating narratives and severe crisis. In particular, the empirical findings illustrate how narratives construct a self-sustaining frame of reference, preventing the organization from questioning the principles underlying its past success. The discussion explains how narratives create self-reinforcing mechanisms and blind spots. It contributes to our understanding of the role of narratives in organizational change efforts and illustrates the way such self-reinforcing blind spots become a potential source of organizational inertia and path-dependence.},

The method has successively been developed into a generalized method of landscape impact analysis of policies, programmes and plans — Landscape Impact Analysis (LIA). This deals with the interaction of human and natural systems and the resulting landscape. The method uses scenario techniques as a way of solving the problems of lack of specificity of policy, a problem which seems underestimated in the development of strategic environmental assessment. The paper describes the main steps of the method and shows examples of the application of the method to changes in Norwegian agricultural policy.},

Wealth–income ratios, inherited wealth, and wealth inequalities were high in the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries up until World War I, then sharply dropped during the twentieth century following World War shocks, and have been rising again in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We discuss the models that can account for these facts. We show that over a wide range of models, the long-run magnitude and concentration of wealth and inheritance are an increasing function of r¯−g where r¯ is the net-of-tax rate of return on wealth and g is the economy's growth rate. This suggests that current trends toward rising wealth–income ratios and wealth inequality might continue during the twenty-first century, both because of the slowdown of population and productivity growth, and because of rising international competition to attract capital.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that avoiding climate change impacts will require proactive adaptation, particularly for infrastructure systems with long lifespans. However, one challenge in adaptation is the uncertainty surrounding climate change projections generated by general circulation models (GCMs). This uncertainty has been addressed in different ways. For example, some researchers use ensembles of GCMs to generate probabilistic climate change projections, but these projections can be highly sensitive to assumptions about model independence and weighting schemes. Because of these issues, others argue that robustness-based approaches to climate adaptation are more appropriate, since they do not rely on a precise probabilistic representation of uncertainty. In this research, we present a new approach for characterizing climate change risks that leverages robust decision frameworks and probabilistic GCM ensembles. The scenario discovery process is used to search across a multi-dimensional space and identify climate scenarios most associated with system failure, and a Bayesian statistical model informed by GCM projections is then developed to estimate the probability of those scenarios. This provides an important advancement in that it can incorporate decision-relevant climate variables beyond mean temperature and precipitation and account for uncertainty in probabilistic estimates in a straightforward way. We also suggest several advancements building on prior approaches to Bayesian modeling of climate change projections to make them more broadly applicable. We demonstrate the methodology using proposed water resources infrastructure in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, where GCM disagreement on changes in future rainfall presents a major challenge for infrastructure planning.},

Even when acknowledging uncertainty about the future, standard approaches (a) characterize uncertainties probabilistically, then optimize objectives in expectation, and/or (b) develop a small number of representative scenarios to explore variation in outcomes under different policy responses. This leaves planners vulnerable to surprise if future conditions diverge from predictions. In this review, we describe contemporary approaches to decision support that address deep uncertainty about future external forcings, system responses, and stakeholder preferences for different outcomes. Many of these methods are motivated by climate change adaptation, infra-structure planning, or natural resources management, and they provide dramatic improvements in the robustness of management strategies. We outline various methods conceptually and describe how they have been applied in a range of landmark real-world planning studies.},

	abstract = {The concept of wicked problems has served as an inspiration for research in a variety of research fields but has also contributed to conceptual confusion through the various ways in which it has been defined and used. In this special issue, a number of ontological, theoretical and methodological issues are discussed. First, while its use as a buzzword has undermined precise conceptual definition, recent work goes beyond the wicked versus tame dichotomy and conceptualizes wickedness as a matter of degree, differentiates between dimensions of wickedness and emphasizes the relational character of problem definitions. Second, new and existing governance approaches have often been unproblematically proposed as ways to solve wicked problems, while only imperfect solutions, partial solutions or small wins are achievable in practice. Third, the concept of wicked problems has had little direct impact on policy theories, and while some argue that the analysis of wicked problems should be mainstreamed in public policy thinking, others propose to reject the concept and rely on existing policy theories. Fourth, as a concept used in policy practice, wicked problems tend to provoke either paralysis or an overestimation of what policy can do about wicked problems. Possible ways forward include (1) leaving the concept behind; (2) using the wicked problems literature as knowledge base to understand when and why policy and governance approaches fail; and (3) developing dimensions of wicked problems (i.e. conflict, complexity and uncertainty) into more analytically precise research tools and linking them with more closely with contemporary policy science developments.},

Renewable groundwater reserves of 1.4 billion cubic meters (BCM), from an estimated available balance of 6.9 BCM, could be pumped to irrigate 613,000 ha of rainfed agricultural land in the Terai plains, with a potential direct economic gain of USD 1.1 billion annually and associated benefits including promotion of energy-based industry, food security and local employment. Governance also plays an important role in addressing water security. We conclude that a nexus-based approach is required for effective water management and governance.},

Understanding the drivers of land-use change and how policies can alter land-use change will be critical to meeting this challenge. Here we project land-use change in the contiguous United States to 2051 under two plausible baseline trajectories of economic conditions to illustrate how differences in underlying market forces can have large impacts on land-use with cascading effects on ecosystem services and wildlife habitat. We project a large increase in croplands (28.2 million ha) under a scenario with high crop demand mirroring conditions starting in 2007, compared with a loss of cropland (11.2 million ha) mirroring conditions in the 1990s. Projected land-use changes result in increases in carbon storage, timber production, food production from increased yields, and {\textgreater}10\% decreases in habitat for 25\% of modeled species. We also analyze policy alternatives designed to encourage forest cover and natural landscapes and reduce urban expansion. Although these policy scenarios modify baseline land-use patterns, they do not reverse powerful underlying trends. Policy interventions need to be aggressive to significantly alter underlying land-use change trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provision.},
