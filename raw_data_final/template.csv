RES.,"THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EVALUATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF GREEN CHEMISTRY AS A POTENTIAL TOOL TO DRIVE THE TRANSITION TO CIRCULARITY. FOR THIS, WE HAVE CARRIED OUT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC STUDY, ANALYZING THOSE DOCUMENTS, PROCESS, OR EXPERIENCES THAT DEALT JOINTLY WITH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY ASPECTS RELATED TO CIRCULARITY SUCH CIRCULAR ECONOMY, INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY, AND CLOSED LOOP. FINDINGS SHOW THAT FEW AUTHORS HAVE TREATED THAT DISCIPLINES TOGETHER IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ACADEMIC LITERATURE, COMMON STRATEGIES (DESIGN, RAW MATERIALS, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT, PROCESSES, NORMATIVE, NEW BUSINESS, AND COLLABORATION), SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES (CATALYST, BIOBASED PRODUCTS ORMETHODS, RECYCLING, AND REUSING), AND DIFFICULTIES TO OVERCOME (METRICS, TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, UNAWARENESS, AND COMPETITIVENESS) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. FINALLY, DIFFERENT KIND OFMEASURES, AS BEHIND SUCH JOINT METRICS, INFORMAL OPEN SPACES, CLOSER THE INDUSTRY, EDUCATION, STANDARDS AND LABEL ARE PROPOSED TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN CHEMISTRY, CIRCULAR ECONOMY, INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY, AND CLOSED LOOP WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF IMPROVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.

MOON S,POWER IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE: AN EXPANDED TYPOLOGY FROM GLOBAL HEALTH,GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH,GLOBAL. HEALTH,"THE EXERCISE OF POWER PERMEATES GLOBAL GOVERNANCE PROCESSES, MAKING POWER A CRITICAL CONCEPT FOR UNDERSTANDING, EXPLAINING, AND INFLUENCING THE INTERSECTION OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND HEALTH. THIS ARTICLE BRIEFLY PRESENTS AND DISCUSSES THREE WELL-ESTABLISHED CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF POWER-DAHL'S, BOURDIEU'S, AND BARNETT AND DUVALL'S-FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, FINDING THAT EACH IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE BUT NONE IS SUFFICIENT. THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF POWER ITSELF NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE MULTIPLE WAYS IN WHICH ONE ACTOR CAN INFLUENCE THE THINKING OR ACTIONS OF OTHERS. I FURTHER ARGUE THAT GLOBAL GOVERNANCE PROCESSES EXHIBIT FEATURES OF COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS, THE ANALYSIS OF WHICH REQUIRES TAKING INTO ACCOUNT MULTIPLE TYPES OF POWER. BUILDING ON ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORKS, THE ARTICLE THEN OFFERS AN EXPANDED TYPOLOGY OF EIGHT KINDS OF POWER: PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC, STRUCTURAL, INSTITUTIONAL, MORAL, DISCURSIVE, EXPERT, AND NETWORK.

BARBIER EB;BURGESS JC,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL INDICATORS: ANALYZING TRADE-OFFS AND COMPLEMENTARITIES,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,WORLD DEV.,"ASSESSMENT OF THE 17 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) HAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON FORMULATING APPROPRIATE TARGETS AND INDICATORS FOR EACH GOAL. MUCH LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO ESTIMATING POSSIBLE TRADEOFFS AND COMPLEMENTARITIES IN ATTAINING THE VARIOUS SDGS. YET SUCH TRADEOFFS AND COMPLEMENTARITIES CLEARLY EXIST. WE DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE WELFARE EFFECTS OF PROGRESS IN ATTAINING ONE SDG WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR INTERACTIONS IN ACHIEVING OTHER SDGS. WE ASSESS QUANTITATIVELY PROGRESS IN THE SDGS OVER 2000-2016 AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL AND FOR LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES, USING A REPRESENTATIVE INDICATOR FOR EACH GOAL. WE THEN ESTIMATE THE WELFARE CHANGES FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN NO POVERTY (SDG1) NET OF ANY WELFARE GAINS AND LOSSES IN ATTAINING EACH OF THE REMAINING 16 GOALS. FOR THE WORLD, WE ESTIMATE THE PER CAPITA WELFARE CHANGE OF REDUCTIONS IN 2000-2016 POVERTY RATES NET OF ANY GAINS OR LOSSES IN ATTAINING EACH OF THE REMAINING 16 GOALS IS \$12,737 PER CAPITA. THIS IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE WELFARE CHANGE OF \$5671 PER PERSON FOR POVERTY REDUCTION ALONE FROM 2000 TO 2016. HOWEVER, ONCE INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER SDGS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, THE NET WELFARE CHANGE FOR POVERTY REDUCTION IN POOR ECONOMIES FROM 2000 TO 2016 IS \$244 PER PERSON, WHICH IS ALMOST 20\% LOWER THAN THE WELFARE ESTIMATE OF \$299 PER CAPITA OF POVERTY REDUCTION ON ITS OWN. SUCH AN ANALYSIS HELPS POLICY MAKERS PRIORITIZE IMPROVEMENTS TOWARDS ONE GOAL OR SET OF GOALS, AND SHOW EXPLICITLY THE NET GAINS AND LOSSES FOR ACHIEVING ONE GOAL WHILE IMPACTING OTHERS. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 2000-2016 THE WORLD MAY HAVE COME CLOSER TO ATTAINING THE NO POVERTY GOAL, BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER CRITICAL SDGS, ESPECIALLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENVIRONMENT.

ANTHROP.,"SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A POTENTIAL METHOD TO EXPLORE FUTURE CHANGE AND STIMULATE A REFLECTIVE PROCESS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO MORE INFORMED DECISION-MAKING. THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS UNDER IPBES (THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL SCIENCE-POLICY PLATFORM ON BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES) HAS HOWEVER SHOWN THAT THE CURRENT PREDOMINANTLY BIOPHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC MODELS AND SCENARIO PROCESSES FOR EXPLORING THE FUTURE OF BIODIVERSITY, ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO HUMAN WELLBEING ARE INSUFFICIENT TO CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITY AND CONTEXT-SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE PROBLEMS FACING THESE SECTORS. SEVERAL IMPORTANT CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT REQUIRE A MORE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF WHERE MORE IMAGINATIVE SCENARIO EFFORTS CAN BE UNDERTAKEN TO ADDRESS THIS GAP. IN THIS PAPER, WE IDENTIFY SIX KEY CHARACTERISTICS NECESSARY FOR SCENARIO PROCESSES: ADAPTABILITY ACROSS DIVERSE CONTEXTS, INCLUSION OF DIVERSE KNOWLEDGE AND VALUE SYSTEMS, LEGITIMATE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THAT FOREGROUNDS THE ROLE OF POWER AND POLITICS, AN ABILITY TO GRAPPLE WITH UNCERTAINTY, INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE THINKING MECHANISMS AND RELEVANCE TO POLICY MAKING. WE COMPARED FOUR CASES OF IMAGINATIVE, ARTS-BASED SCENARIO PROCESSES THAT EACH OFFER ASPECTS OF MEETING THESE CRITERIA. THESE APPROACHES EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENGAGING THE IMAGINATION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN A PROCESS AND HARNESSING IT AS A TOOL FOR IDENTIFYING AND CONCEPTUALISING MORE TRANSFORMATIVE FUTURE TRAJECTORIES. DRAWING ON THE EXISTING LITERATURE, WE ARGUE THAT THERE IS VALUE IN FOSTERING MORE INCLUSIVE AND CREATIVE PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING MULTIPLE VALUE SYSTEMS AND RELATIONSHIPS IN ORDER TO REIMAGINE A MORE INCLUSIVE AND JUST FUTURE. BASED ON THIS, WE REFLECT ON FUTURE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE TRANSFORMATIVE ROLE THAT IMAGINATION CAN PLAY IN ALTERING AND ENHANCING KNOWLEDGE-MAKING FOR GLOBAL ASSESSMENTS, INCLUDING IPBES. WE CONCLUDE THAT CREATIVE SCENARIO CO-DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES THAT PROMOTE IMAGINATION AND CREATE AN OPENING FOR MORE EMPATHETIC RESPONSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS COMPLEMENTARY TOOLS WITHIN THE SUITE OF METHODOLOGIES USED FOR FUTURE IPBES SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT.",SCENARIOS; IMAGINATION; TRANSFORMATION; IPBES; CO-PRODUCTION; ARTS,ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY; KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS; CLIMATE FUTURES; RESILIENCE; IPBES; CONSERVATION; THEATER; EXPERIENCES; FRAMEWORK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"PEREIRA, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), STELLENBOSCH UNIV, CTR COMPLEX SYST TRANSIT, STELLENBOSCH, SOUTH AFRICA.;PEREIRA, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), CITY UNIV LONDON, CTR FOOD POLICY, LONDON, ENGLAND.;PEREIRA, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV STOCKHOLM, STOCKHOLM RESILIENCE CTR, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.;PEREIRA, LAURA, SITAS, NADIA, STELLENBOSCH UNIV, CTR COMPLEX SYST TRANSIT, STELLENBOSCH, SOUTH AFRICA.;PEREIRA, LAURA, CITY UNIV LONDON, CTR FOOD POLICY, LONDON, ENGLAND.;PEREIRA, LAURA, JIMENEZ-ACEITUNO, AMANDA, MERRIE, ANDREW, UNIV STOCKHOLM, STOCKHOLM RESILIENCE CTR, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.;SITAS, NADIA, STELLENBOSCH UNIV, DEPT CONSERVAT ECOL \& ENTOMOL, STELLENBOSCH, SOUTH AFRICA.;RAVERA, FEDERICA, UNIV EVORA, ICAAM, EVORA, PORTUGAL.;RAVERA, FEDERICA, UNIV VICTORIA, CENT UNIV CATALUNYA, CHAIR AGROECOL, VIC, SPAIN.",10.1525/ELEMENTA.374,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",35,NA,"SIDA; MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS (SPAIN) [IJCI-2015-25586]; AXA RESEARCH FUND (2017-2019); MISTRA (THE SWEDISH FOUNDATION FOR STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH); FORMAS (SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT); NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF SOUTH AFRICANATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION - SOUTH AFRICA [115300]","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS OF THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THEIR INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS AND -SUGGESTIONS FOR STRENGTHENING THE PAPER.

SOC.,"SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS (SES) ARE COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS. SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM PHENOMENA, SUCH AS REGIME SHIFTS, TRANSFORMATIONS, OR TRAPS, EMERGE FROM INTERACTIONS AMONG AND BETWEEN HUMAN AND NONHUMAN ENTITIES WITHIN AND ACROSS SCALES. ANALYSES OF SES PHENOMENA THUS REQUIRE APPROACHES THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR (1) THE INTERTWINEDNESS OF SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND (2) THE WAYS THEY JOINTLY GIVE RISE TO EMERGENT SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL PATTERNS, STRUCTURES, AND DYNAMICS THAT FEEDBACK ON THE ENTITIES AND PROCESSES THAT GENERATED THEM. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK OF LINKED ACTION SITUATIONS (AS) AS A TOOL TO CAPTURE THOSE INTERACTIONS THAT ARE HYPOTHESIZED TO HAVE JOINTLY AND DYNAMICALLY GENERATED A SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL PHENOMENON OF INTEREST. THE FRAMEWORK EXTENDS THE CONCEPT OF AN ACTION SITUATION TO PROVIDE A CONCEPTUALIZATION OF SES THAT FOCUSSES ON SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS AND THEIR LINKS ACROSS LEVELS. THE AIM OF OUR SE-AS (SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL ACTION SITUATIONS) FRAMEWORK IS TO SUPPORT A PROCESS OF DEVELOPING HYPOTHESES ABOUT CONFIGURATIONS OF ASS THAT MAY EXPLAIN AN EMERGENT SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL PHENOMENON. WE SUGGEST SIX SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL ASS ALONG WITH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL ACTION SITUATIONS THAT CAN COMMONLY BE FOUND IN NATURAL RESOURCE OR ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT CONTEXTS. WE TEST THE ABILITY OF THE FRAMEWORK TO STRUCTURE AN ANALYSIS OF PROCESSES OF EMERGENCE BY APPLYING IT TO DIFFERENT CASE STUDIES OF REGIME SHIFTS, TRAPS, AND SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE. THE FRAMEWORK GOES BEYOND EXISTING FRAMEWORKS AND APPROACHES, SUCH AS THE SES FRAMEWORK OR CAUSAL LOOP DIAGRAMS, BY ESTABLISHING A WAY OF ANALYZING SES THAT FOCUSES ON THE INTERPLAY OF SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE EMERGENT OUTCOMES THEY PRODUCE. WE CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING THE ADDED VALUE OF THE FRAMEWORK AND DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT PURPOSES IT CAN SERVE: FROM SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEORIES OF THE EMERGENCE OF SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL PHENOMENA, ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY OF SES UNDERSTANDINGS TO SERVING AS A BOUNDARY OBJECT FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION.",ACTION SITUATION; AGENCY; COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS; EMERGENCE; EXPLANATION; INTERTWINDNESS,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; EUTROPHICATION CONTROL; NEWFOUNDLAND; DYNAMICS; RESOURCE; COD; SUSTAINABILITY; CONNECTION; COMPLEXITY; MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"SCHLUTER, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV STOCKHOLM, STOCKHOLM RESILIENCE CTR, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.;SCHLUTER, MAJA, HAIDER, L.

SOC.,"SCENARIO ANALYSES HAVE BEEN USED IN MULTIPLE SCIENCE-POLICY ASSESSMENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COMPLEX PLAUSIBLE FUTURES. SCENARIO ARCHETYPE APPROACHES ARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT MANY FUTURE SCENARIOS HAVE SIMILAR UNDERLYING STORYLINES, ASSUMPTIONS, AND TRENDS IN DRIVERS OF CHANGE, WHICH ALLOWS FOR GROUPING OF SCENARIOS INTO TYPOLOGIES, OR ARCHETYPES, FACILITATING COMPARISONS BETWEEN A LARGE RANGE OF STUDIES. THE USE OF SCENARIO ARCHETYPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS FOREGROUNDS IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS AND CAN BE USED TO CODESIGN INTERVENTIONS TACKLING FUTURE SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES. RECENTLY, SCENARIO ARCHETYPES WERE USED IN FOUR REGIONAL ASSESSMENTS AND ONE ONGOING GLOBAL ASSESSMENT WITHIN THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL SCIENCE-POLICY PLATFORM FOR BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (IPBES). THE AIM OF THESE ASSESSMENTS WAS TO PROVIDE DECISION MAKERS WITH POLICY-RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE STATE OF BIODIVERSITY, ECOSYSTEMS, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY PROVIDE TO PEOPLE. THIS PAPER REFLECTS ON THE USEFULNESS OF THE SCENARIO ARCHETYPE APPROACH WITHIN SCIENCE-POLICY PROCESSES, DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCE FROM THE IPBES ASSESSMENTS. USING A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF (A) SURVEY DATA COLLECTED FROM EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE ARCHETYPE ANALYSES ACROSS IPBES ASSESSMENTS, (B) NOTES FROM IPBES WORKSHOPS, AND (C) REGIONAL ASSESSMENT CHAPTER TEXTS, WE SYNTHESIZE THE BENEFITS, CHALLENGES, AND FRONTIERS OF APPLYING THE SCENARIO ARCHETYPE APPROACH IN A SCIENCE-POLICY PROCESS. SCENARIO ARCHETYPES WERE PERCEIVED TO ALLOW SYNTHESES OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION FOR SCIENTIFIC, PRACTICE-, AND POLICY-RELATED PURPOSES, STREAMLINE KEY MESSAGES FROM MULTIPLE SCENARIO STUDIES, AND FACILITATE COMMUNICATION OF THEM TO END USERS.

WE ARGUE THAT SUCH A THEORETICALLY-INFORMED MAPPING OF POWER IN INSTITUTIONS WILL ENABLE SCHOLARS, PRACTITIONERS, AND CITIZEN GROUPS TO GO BEYOND THE STANDARD CRITIQUES IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE MULTIFACETED EFFECTS OF NEOLIBERAL INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. OUR INTRODUCTION DRAWS ON AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW AS WELL AS THE SPECIAL ISSUE CONTRIBUTORS WHO EXAMINE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN A VARIETY OF POLICY SECTORS IN AFRICA, SOUTH ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AND NORTH AMERICA. WE FIND THAT A RANGE OF DIVERSE LOCAL, NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL ACTORS, WITH DISPARATE ACCESS TO POWER, NEGOTIATE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES FROM ABOVE AND BELOW THROUGH OVERT IMPOSITION OF AND RESISTANCE TO NEW RULES, INFLUENCE OF AGENDAS, AND PROMOTION OF DISCOURSES. NEOLIBERALISM THUS CREATES A NEW DISTRIBUTIVE POLITICS. THE SPECIAL ISSUE THUS OFFERS A THEORETICALLY-GROUNDED APPROACH FOR LINKING INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC POWER DIFFERENCES TO THE PROCESS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. IN A DEPARTURE FROM THE CURRENT LITERATURE'S FOCUS ON ELITE BARGAINS, WE SHOWCASE THE EFFORTS BY LESS POWERFUL GROUPS TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD.

BRISBOIS MC;MORRIS M;DE LOE R,AUGMENTING THE IAD FRAMEWORK TO REVEAL POWER IN COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE - AN ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION TO RESOURCE INDUSTRY DOMINATED PROCESSES,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,WORLD DEV.,"COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE IS OFTEN USED AS A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE COMMON POOL RESOURCE (CPR) PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT POWER IMBALANCES CAN CONSTRAIN THE CREATION, ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY DESIRABLE POLICIES. THIS STUDY INTEGRATES THEORY ON POWER WITH THE INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS AND DESIGN (IAD) FRAMEWORK IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR EXAMINING POWER THAT IS NOT CAPTURED THROUGH THE IAD'S FOCUS ON ACTION SITUATIONS. WE EXAMINED THE USE OF COLLABORATION IN CPR GOVERNANCE CONTEXTS CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT POWER IMBALANCES. TWO CANADIAN COLLABORATIVE PROCESSES THAT INVOLVE LARGE ENERGY INDUSTRY INTERESTS WERE STUDIED. WE ASSESSED THE ABILITY OF THESE COLLABORATIVE PROCESSES TO ADDRESS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT HIDDEN POWER DYNAMICS RELATED TO INACTION AND NON-DECISIONS. COLLABORATION WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE PROGRESSIVE OUTCOMES BECAUSE OF I) THE RESTRICTION OF THE COLLABORATIVE AGENDA BY POWERFUL ACTORS, II) SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF RULES, AND, III) A BROADER NEOLIBERAL CONTEXT THAT INHERENTLY FAVOURED INCREASING RESOURCE EXTRACTION. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES THROUGH COLLABORATION IS CONSTRAINED WHERE POWERFUL RESOURCE INDUSTRIES ARE PRESENT AS PARTICIPANTS.

RENARD D;TILMAN D,NATIONAL FOOD PRODUCTION STABILIZED BY CROP DIVERSITY,NATURE,NATURE,"INCREASING GLOBAL FOOD DEMAND, LOW GRAIN RESERVES AND CLIMATE CHANGE THREATEN THE STABILITY OF FOOD SYSTEMS ON NATIONAL TO GLOBAL SCALES(1-5). POLICIES TO INCREASE YIELDS, IRRIGATION AND TOLERANCE OF CROPS TO DROUGHT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS STABILITY-ENHANCING SOLUTIONS(1,6,7). HERE WE EVALUATE A COMPLEMENTARY POSSIBILITY-THAT GREATER DIVERSITY OF CROPS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL MAY INCREASE THE YEAR-TO-YEAR STABILITY OF THE TOTAL NATIONAL HARVEST OF ALL CROPS COMBINED. WE TEST THIS CROP DIVERSITY-STABILITY HYPOTHESIS USING 5 DECADES OF DATA ON ANNUAL YIELDS OF 176 CROP SPECIES IN 91 NATIONS. WE FIND THAT GREATER EFFECTIVE DIVERSITY OF CROPS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED TEMPORAL STABILITY OF TOTAL NATIONAL HARVEST. CROP DIVERSITY HAS STABILIZING EFFECTS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN MAGNITUDE TO THE OBSERVED DESTABILIZING EFFECTS OF VARIABILITY IN PRECIPITATION. THIS GREATER STABILITY REFLECTS MARKEDLY LOWER FREQUENCIES OF YEARS WITH SHARP HARVEST LOSSES. DIVERSITY EFFECTS REMAINED ROBUST AFTER STATISTICALLY CONTROLLING FOR IRRIGATION, FERTILIZATION, PRECIPITATION, TEMPERATURE AND OTHER VARIABLES, AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE VARIANCE-SCALING CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUAL CROPS REQUIRED BY THEORY(8,9) FOR DIVERSITY TO LEAD TO STABILITY. ENSURING STABLE FOOD SUPPLIES IS A CHALLENGE THAT WILL PROBABLY REQUIRE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS.

RES. LETT.,"BACKGROUND: THE PLANETARY BOUNDARIES CONCEPT (PBC) HAS EMERGED AS A KEY GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY CONCEPT IN INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ARENAS. INITIALLY PRESENTED AS AN AGENDA FOR GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY RESEARCH, IT NOW SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE. WEUSE THE FACT THAT IT IS WIDELY CITED IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE (>3500 CITATIONS) AND AN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED CONCEPT TO ANALYSE HOW IT HAS BEEN USED AND DEVELOPED SINCE ITS FIRST PUBLICATION. DESIGN: FROM THE LITERATURE THAT CITES THE PBC, WE SELECT THOSE ARTICLES THAT HAVE THE TERMS `PLANETARY BOUNDARIES' OR `SAFE OPERATING SPACE' IN EITHER TITLE, ABSTRACT OR KEYWORDS. WEASSUME THAT THIS LITERATURE SUBSTANTIVELY ENGAGES WITH AND DEVELOPS THE PBC. RESULTS: WEFIND THAT 6\% OF THE CITING LITERATURE ENGAGES WITH THE CONCEPT. WITHIN THIS FRACTION OF THE LITERATURE WE DISTINGUISH COMMENTARIES-THAT DISCUSS THE CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING THE PBC, ARTICLES THAT DEVELOP THE CORE BIOGEOPHYSICAL CONCEPT AND ARTICLES THAT APPLY THE CONCEPT BY TRANSLATING TO SUB-GLOBAL SCALES AND BY ADDING A HUMAN COMPONENT TO IT. APPLIED LITERATURE ADDS TO THE CONCEPT BY EXPLICITLY INCLUDING SOCIETY THROUGH PERSPECTIVES OF IMPACTS, NEEDS, ASPIRATIONS AND BEHAVIOURS. DISCUSSION: LITERATURE APPLYING THE CONCEPT DOES NOT YET INCLUDE THE MORE COMPLEX, DIVERSE, CULTURAL AND BEHAVIOURAL FACET OF HUMANITY THAT IS IMPLIED IN COMMENTARY LITERATURE. WESUGGEST THERE IS NEED FOR A POSITIVE FRAMING OF SUSTAINABILITY GOALS-AS A SAFE OPERATING SPACE RATHER THAN BOUNDARIES. KEY SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGES INCLUDE DISTINGUISHING GENERALISED FROM CONTEXT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, CLARIFYING WHICH PROCESSES ARE GENERALIZABLE AND WHICH ARE SCALABLE, AND EXPLICITLY APPLYING COMPLEX SYSTEMS' KNOWLEDGE IN THE APPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PBC.

THIS PAPER OPENS UP TO DIVERSEVISIONS OF ENERGYTRANSITIONS BY STUDYING A CORPUS OF 12 VISIONS PRODUCED ACROSS DIFFERENTINSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS' OF THE STATE, BUSINESS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE UK. WE INTRODUCE A NEW ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK GROUNDED IN RELATIONAL CO-PRODUCTIONIST PERSPECTIVES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES (STS) TO COMPARATIVELY ANALYSETHE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES OF THE VISIONS IN RELATION TOFOUR DIMENSIONS OFSOCIOTECHNICAL TRANSFORMATION: MEANINGS, KNOWINGS, DOINGS, AND ORGANISINGS.

THE PRESENT STUDY ANALYZES THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF A POTENTIAL DISINTEGRATION OF THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET (GIS). THE STUDY INTRODUCES AN APPROACH THAT COMBINES LONG-RUN ECONOMIC GROWTH MODELS, CLIMATE MODELS, AND REDUCED-FORM GIS MODELS. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT SOCIAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND DAMAGE-LIMITING STRATEGIES CAN BE USEFULLY EXTENDED TO ILLUMINATE ISSUES WITH MAJOR LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES, AS WELL AS CONCERNS SUCH AS POTENTIAL TIPPING POINTS, IRREVERSIBILITY, AND HYSTERESIS. A KEY FINDING IS THAT, UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF ASSUMPTIONS, THE RISK OF GIS DISINTEGRATION MAKES A SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO THE OPTIMAL STRINGENCY OF CURRENT POLICY OR TO THE OVERALL SOCIAL COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE, A NUMBER OF ONTOLOGICAL, THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES ARE DISCUSSED. FIRST, WHILE ITS USE AS A BUZZWORD HAS UNDERMINED PRECISE CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION, RECENT WORK GOES BEYOND THE WICKED VERSUS TAME DICHOTOMY AND CONCEPTUALIZES WICKEDNESS AS A MATTER OF DEGREE, DIFFERENTIATES BETWEEN DIMENSIONS OF WICKEDNESS AND EMPHASIZES THE RELATIONAL CHARACTER OF PROBLEM DEFINITIONS. SECOND, NEW AND EXISTING GOVERNANCE APPROACHES HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNPROBLEMATICALLY PROPOSED AS WAYS TO SOLVE WICKED PROBLEMS, WHILE ONLY IMPERFECT SOLUTIONS, PARTIAL SOLUTIONS OR SMALL WINS ARE ACHIEVABLE IN PRACTICE. THIRD, THE CONCEPT OF WICKED PROBLEMS HAS HAD LITTLE DIRECT IMPACT ON POLICY THEORIES, AND WHILE SOME ARGUE THAT THE ANALYSIS OF WICKED PROBLEMS SHOULD BE MAINSTREAMED IN PUBLIC POLICY THINKING, OTHERS PROPOSE TO REJECT THE CONCEPT AND RELY ON EXISTING POLICY THEORIES. FOURTH, AS A CONCEPT USED IN POLICY PRACTICE, WICKED PROBLEMS TEND TO PROVOKE EITHER PARALYSIS OR AN OVERESTIMATION OF WHAT POLICY CAN DO ABOUT WICKED PROBLEMS. POSSIBLE WAYS FORWARD INCLUDE (1) LEAVING THE CONCEPT BEHIND, (2) USING THE WICKED PROBLEMS LITERATURE AS KNOWLEDGE BASE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN AND WHY POLICY AND GOVERNANCE APPROACHES FAIL, AND (3) DEVELOPING DIMENSIONS OF WICKED PROBLEMS (I.E. CONFLICT, COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY) INTO MORE ANALYTICALLY PRECISE RESEARCH TOOLS AND LINKING THEM WITH MORE CLOSELY WITH CONTEMPORARY POLICY SCIENCE DEVELOPMENTS.",GOVERNANCE; DECISION-MAKING; WICKED PROBLEMS; POLICY,GOVERNANCE,ENGLISH,EDITORIAL MATERIAL,ARTICLE,1,"TERMEER, CJAM (REPRINT AUTHOR), WAGENINGEN UNIV, PUBL ADM \& POLICY GRP, HOLLANDSEWEG 1, NL-6700 EW WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS.;TERMEER, CATRIEN J.

ENVIRON. CHANGE-HUMAN POLICY DIMENS.,"WITH A RANGE OF POTENTIAL PATHWAYS TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PARIS AGREEMENT 1.5 DEGREES C TARGET, SCENARIO ANALYSIS HAS EMERGED AS A KEY TOOL IN STUDIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION. A WIDE RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS HAVE BEEN CREATED, AND CORE AMONGST THESE ARE FIVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SCENARIOS (SHARED SOCIO-ECONOMIC PATHWAYS OR SSPS) AND FOUR EMISSION SCENARIOS (REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAYS OR RCPS). WHILST MITIGATION SCENARIOS (THE SHARED POLICY ASSUMPTIONS, OR SPAS) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR EACH SSP-RCP COMBINATION, DESCRIBING THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO MATCH THE CLIMATE PATHWAY OF THE RCP, THERE HAS NOT YET BEEN A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO ADDRESS WHETHER AND HOW THESE ACTIONS CAN BE ENABLED IN PRACTICE. WE PRESENT A NOVEL AND TRANSFERABLE FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND SOCIETY'S CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE THE 1.5 DEGREES C TARGET, BASED ON FOUR PARTICIPATORY CASE STUDIES USING THE SSP-RCP SCENARIOS. THE METHODOLOGY BUILDS ON A FRAMEWORK FOR CATEGORISING DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIETAL CAPITALS AND CAPACITIES AND ASSESSING THEIR IMPACT ON THE POTENTIAL TO IMPLEMENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF MITIGATION ACTIONS. ALL FOUR CASE STUDIES SHOW THAT SSP1 HAS THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL TO REACH THE TARGET. ALTHOUGH ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS IS HIGH IN BOTH SSP1 AND SSP4, CONTINUED SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN SSP4 RESTRICT SOCIETY'S CAPACITY TO TRANSFORM, DESPITE ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN THE TWO LEAST ENVIRONMENTALLY-AWARE SSPS, SSP3 AND SSP5, THE TRANSFORMATION POTENTIAL IS LOW, BUT THE VIEW ON CAPITALS AND CAPACITIES NONETHELESS HELPS IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTORS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT MITIGATION ACTIONS. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT TECHNO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS OF CLIMATE STRATEGIES NEED TO BE COMPLEMENTED BY CONSIDERATION OF THE CRITICAL ROLE PLAYED BY SOCIAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL, AND BY SOCIETAL CAPACITY TO MOBILISE AND CREATE THESE CAPITALS DESPITE DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC TRENDS.

THE GUIDELINES ARE ARRANGED UNDER THREE HEADINGS: FOUNDATIONAL, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, AND SUPPORTING SUSTAINABILITY IN THE LONG TERM. UNDER FOUNDATIONAL, WE ADDRESS THE NEED FOR CO-OPERATION WITH END USERS OF DECISION-SUPPORT RESOURCES, THE CONTRIBUTION THESE RESOURCES CAN MAKE TO THE FORMATION OF THRIVING COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE, AND THE MATCH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DECISION SUPPORT AND USER NEEDS. UNDER DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, WE POINT TO THE RISK THAT POLICY SETTINGS WILL CHANGE OVER THE MULTIPLE YEARS REQUIRED TO BUILD AND PUBLISH COMPLEX DECISION-SUPPORT RESOURCES, REDUCING THE RELEVANCE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. WE DISCUSS THE NEED FOR INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO ENSURE VISIBILITY, CREDIBILITY AND HENCE UPTAKE. DEVELOPERS SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THE REQUIREMENTS, RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES OF POTENTIAL USERS AT ALL POINTS IN THE DESIGN AND BUILD. WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT DECISION-SUPPORT RESOURCES MAY BE TRANSFERABLE BETWEEN SECTORS AND LOCATIONS, BUT THE MOTIVATION SHOULD BE AROUND ACHIEVING EXCELLENCE, AND NOT JUST COST SAVINGS. UNDER SUPPORTING SUSTAINABILITY IN THE LONG TERM, WE STRESS THE NEED FOR EVALUATION AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF PERFORMANCE, LEADING TO CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED UPDATING AND IMPROVEMENT OF DECISION-SUPPORT RESOURCES.

OLIVER K;KOTHARI A;MAYS N,THE DARK SIDE OF COPRODUCTION: DO THE COSTS OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS FOR HEALTH RESEARCH?,HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS,HEALTH RES. POLICY SYST.,"BACKGROUND: COPRODUCTION, A COLLABORATIVE MODEL OF RESEARCH THAT INCLUDES STAKEHOLDERS IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS, HAS BEEN WIDELY ADVOCATED AS A MEANS OF FACILITATING RESEARCH USE AND IMPACT. WE SUMMARISE THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF COPRODUCTION, THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ESTABLISHING COPRODUCTIVE WORK AND THEIR COSTS, AND OFFER SOME ADVICE AS TO WHEN AND HOW TO CONSIDER COPRODUCTION. DEBATE: DESPITE THE MULTIPLICITY OF REASONS AND INCENTIVES TO COPRODUCE, THERE IS LITTLE CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT COPRODUCTION IS, WHY WE DO IT, WHAT EFFECTS WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE, OR THE BEST COPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE POLICY, PRACTICE OR POPULATION HEALTH CHANGE. FURTHERMORE, COPRODUCTION IS NOT FREE RISK OR COST. TENSIONS CAN ARISE THROUGHOUT COPRODUCED RESEARCH PROCESSES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT INTERESTS INVOLVED. WE IDENTIFY FIVE TYPES OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COPRODUCED RESEARCH AFFECTING THE RESEARCH ITSELF, THE RESEARCH PROCESS, PROFESSIONAL RISKS FOR RESEARCHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, PERSONAL RISKS FOR RESEARCHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, AND RISKS TO THE WIDER CAUSE OF SCHOLARSHIP. YET, THESE COSTS ARE RARELY REFERRED TO IN THE LITERATURE, WHICH GENERALLY CALLS FOR GREATER INCLUSION OF STAKEHOLDERS IN RESEARCH PROCESSES, FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON POTENTIAL POSITIVES. THERE ARE FEW TOOLS TO HELP RESEARCHERS AVOID OR ALLEVIATE RISKS TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR STAKEHOLDERS. CONCLUSIONS: FIRST, WE RECOMMEND IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC MOTIVATIONS FOR COPRODUCTION AND CLARIFYING EXACTLY WHICH OUTCOMES ARE REQUIRED FOR WHOM FOR ANY PARTICULAR PIECE OF RESEARCH. SECOND, WE SUGGEST SELECTING STRATEGIES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ENABLE THESE OUTCOMES TO BE ACHIEVED, AND PROPERLY EVALUATED. FINALLY, IN THE ABSENCE OF STRONG EVIDENCE ABOUT THE IMPACT AND PROCESS OF COPRODUCTION, WE ADVISE A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO COPRODUCTION. THIS WOULD INVOLVE CONSCIOUS AND REFLECTIVE RESEARCH PRACTICE, EVALUATION OF HOW COPRODUCED RESEARCH PRACTICES CHANGE OUTCOMES, AND EXPLORATION OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF COPRODUCTION.

A.,"AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION REMAINS THE MOST PROMINENT PROXIMATE CAUSE OF TROPICAL DEFORESTATION IN LATIN AMERICA, A REGION CHARACTERIZED BY DEFORESTATION RATES SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE WORLD AVERAGE AND EXTREMELY HIGH INEQUALITY. THIS PAPER DEPLOYS SEVERAL MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL MODELS TO TEST WHETHER DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF INEQUALITY, WITHIN A CONTEXT OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION (JEVONS PARADOX) OR CONTRACTION (LAND-SPARING) IN 10 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES OVER 1990-2010. HERE I SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF DISTINCT PATTERNS BETWEEN THE INSTANTANEOUS AND THE OVERALL (I.E., ACCOUNTING FOR TEMPORAL LAGS) EFFECT OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, CONDITIONAL ON THE DEGREE OF INCOME, LAND, AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. IN A CONTEXT OF PERFECT EQUALITY, THE INSTANTANEOUS EFFECT OF INCREASES IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IS TO PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION (JEVONS PARADOX). WHEN TEMPORAL LAGS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY APPEARS TO BE MAINLY LAND-SPARING. INCREASES IN THE LEVEL OF INEQUALITY, IN ALL ITS FORMS, PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION, THUS ERODING THE LAND-SPARING EFFECTS OF INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE INSTANTANEOUS IMPACT OF INEQUALITY IS LARGER THAN THE OVERALL EFFECT (ACCOUNTING FOR TEMPORAL LAGS) AND THAT THE EFFECTS OF INCOME INEQUALITY ARE STRONGER THAN THOSE OF LAND AND WEALTH INEQUALITY, RESPECTIVELY.

KUEHNHANSS CR,THE CHALLENGES OF BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS FOR EFFECTIVE POLICY DESIGN,POLICY AND SOCIETY,POLICY SOC.,"BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR WITH POLICY PRACTITIONERS. FINDINGS AND METHODS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED BY COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND LATER BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS HAVE FOUND USE IN THE FORMULATION OF PUBLIC POLICIES. THEIR MOST POPULARISED APPLICATION HAS EMERGED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF LIBERTARIAN PATERNALISM IN THE FORM OF `NUDGING'. ITS PROPONENTS CLAIM TO PROVIDE A NEW INSTRUMENT TO FACILITATE THE FORMULATION OF EFFECTIVE AND EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY, TAKING PEOPLE'S ACTUAL BEHAVIOUR INTO ACCOUNT FROM THE OUTSET, WHILE PRESERVING THEIR LIBERTY TO CHOOSE. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE ORIGINS OF LIBERTARIAN PATERNALISM AND THE BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS IT BUILDS ON AND TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE FOUNDATIONS NUDGING RELIES ON AS A POLICY TOOL. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE ONGOING EFFORTS TO BUILD POLICY CAPACITY TO INTEGRATE BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS IN THE CREATION OF PUBLIC POLICY. BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS OFFER A POWERFUL TOOL TO RESHAPE AND DESIGN NEW EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY.

MUCH LESS WORK HAS FOCUSED ON HOW TO MANAGE EFFECTIVE TRANSNATIONAL MULTISTAKEHOLDER LEARNING DIALOGUES, MANY OF WHICH AIM TO HELP ADDRESS CRITICAL GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE OR BIODIVERSITY LOSS. THEY FACE THREE CENTRAL CHALLENGES. FIRST, THEY RARELY SHAPE POLICIES AND BEHAVIORS DIRECTLY, BUT WORK TO `NUDGE' OR `TIP THE SCALES' IN DOMESTIC SETTINGS. SECOND, THEY RUN THE RISK OF GENERATING `COMPROMISE' APPROACHES INCAPABLE OF AMELIORATING THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM DEFINITION FOR WHICH THE DIALOGUE WAS CREATED. THIRD, THEY RUN THE RISK OF BEING OVERLY INFLUENCED, OR CAPTURED, BY POWERFUL INTERESTS WHOSE RATIONALE FOR PARTICIPATING IS TO SHIFT PROBLEM DEFINITIONS OR NARROW INSTRUMENT CHOICES TO THOSE INNOCUOUS TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL OR INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS. DRAWING ON POLICY LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP, WE IDENTIFY A SIX-STAGE LEARNING PROCESS FOR ANTICIPATING EFFECTIVENESS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY FOSTERING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR MEANINGFUL AND LONGLASTING PROBLEM SOLVING: PROBLEM DEFINITION ASSESSMENTS, PROBLEM FRAMING, DEVELOPING COALITION MEMBERSHIP, CAUSAL FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT, SCOPING EXERCISES, KNOWLEDGE INSTITUTIONALIZATION. WE ALSO IDENTIFY SIX MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES WITHIN EACH PROCESS FOR ENGAGING TRANSNATIONAL DIALOGUES AROUND PROBLEM SOLVING.

ALL THREE ARE EPISTEMOLOGICALLY ROOTED IN AN EVOLUTIONARY UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIO-TECHNICAL CHANGE. WHILE THESE APPROACHES ARE APPROPRIATE TO UNDERSTAND MARKET-DRIVEN PROCESSES OF CHANGE, THEY MAY BE DEFICIENT AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS FOR EXPLORING AND DESIGNING PROCESSES OF PURPOSIVE SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARGUE THAT THE EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISM OF SELECTION IS THE KEY TO INTRODUCING THE STRONG DIRECTIONALITY REQUIRED FOR PURPOSIVE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE. IN ALL THREE INNOVATION THEORIES, WE FIND THAT THE PRIME SELECTION ENVIRONMENT IS CONSTITUTED BY THE MARKET AND, THUS, NORMATIVE SOCIETAL GOALS LIKE SUSTAINABILITY ARE SIDELINED. CONSEQUENTLY, SELECTION IS DEPOLITICISED AND NEITHER STRONG DIRECTIONALITY NOR INCUMBENT REGIME DESTABILISATION ARE SOCIETALLY STEERED.

OVER TIME, DIVERSE CRITIQUES OF CPR THEORY HAVE ALSO EMERGED. PROMINENT CRITIQUES INCLUDE INATTENTION TO POWER AND COERCION, ASSUMPTIONS THAT INSTITUTIONS CAN BE CRAFTED, AND ANALYSES THAT EXCLUDE HISTORY AND CONTEXT, AMONG OTHERS. WE LABEL THIS LITERATURE CRITICAL COMMONS SCHOLARSHIP. IN THIS REVIEW PAPER, WE DEFINE A TYPOLOGY OF FIVE TYPES OF CRITICAL COMMONS SCHOLARSHIP. THE FUNCTIONALIST CRITIQUE (TYPE 1) ARGUES THAT A NARROW FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONS THAT EXCLUDES HISTORY, CONTEXT, AND CONTINGENCIES CAUSES ERRONEOUS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE CAUSES OF RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY. THE APOLITICAL MANAGEMENT CRITIQUE (TYPE 2) ARGUES THAT A FOCUS ON RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY CAUSES COMMONS SCHOLARS TO IGNORE HOW POWER IS USED TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN INEQUALITIES THROUGH RULES AND NORMS STRUCTURING RESOURCE ACCESS. THE METHODOLOGICAL CRITIQUE (TYPE 3) ARGUES THAT METHODOLOGICAL INCOMPATIBILITIES, SUCH AS CPR THEORY'S DEPENDENCE ON GENERAL, ABSTRACT MODELS, NECESSARILY PREVENT THESE SCHOLARS FROM RESPONDING TO TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 CRITIQUES. THE PROJECT OF GOVERNMENT CRITIQUE (TYPE 4) ARGUES THAT COMMON-POOL RESOURCE THEORY IS USED TO SUPPORT NEOLIBERAL AND HEGEMONIC PRACTICES. FINALLY, THE ETHICAL CRITIQUE (TYPE 5) ARGUES THAT COMMON-POOL RESOURCE THEORY IS PREMISED ON PROBLEMATIC NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONSHIPS WHERE EXPERT SCHOLARS IN THE GLOBAL NORTH PROVIDE INFORMATION TO BE CONSUMED BY ``COMMONERS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH. MAINSTREAM CPR THEORY HAS BEEN LIMITED IN ENGAGING WITH CRITICAL COMMONS SCHOLARSHIP, BUT THERE ARE NEW TOOLS (SUCH AS THE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK AND THE CRITICAL INSTITUTIONALISM APPROACH) FOR ADDRESSING EACH TYPE OF CRITIQUE.

NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.,"CURRENT THEORETICAL MODELS OF THE COMMONS ASSERT THAT COMMON-POOL RESOURCES CAN ONLY BE MANAGED SUSTAINABLY WITH CLEARLY DEFINED BOUNDARIES AROUND BOTH COMMUNITIES AND THE RESOURCES THAT THEY USE. IN THESE THEORETICAL MODELS, OPEN ACCESS INEVITABLY LEADS TO A TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS. HOWEVER, IN MANY OPEN ACCESS SYSTEMS, USE OF COMMON-POOL RESOURCES SEEMS TO BE SUSTAINABLE OVER THE LONG TERM (I.E., CURRENT RESOURCE USE DOES NOT THREATEN USE OF COMMON-POOL RESOURCES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS). HERE, WE OUTLINE THE CONDITIONS THAT SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE IN OPEN PROPERTY REGIMES. WE USE THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS TO EXPLAIN HOW PROCESSES WITHIN AND COUPLINGS BETWEEN HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEMS CAN LEAD TO THE EMERGENCE OF EFFICIENT, EQUITABLE, AND SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE. WE ILLUSTRATE THESE DYNAMICS IN EIGHT CASE STUDIES OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING MOBILE PASTORALISM, MARINE AND FRESHWATER FISHERIES, SWIDDEN AGRICULTURE, AND DESERT FORAGING. OUR THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK IDENTIFIES EIGHT CONDITIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE EMERGENCE OF SUSTAINABLE USE OF COMMON-POOL RESOURCES IN OPEN PROPERTY REGIMES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPLAIN HOW CHANGES IN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS MAY PUSH OPEN PROPERTY REGIMES TO EITHER COMMON PROPERTY REGIMES OR A TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS. OUR THEORETICAL MODEL OF EMERGENT SUSTAINABILITY HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND THE DIVERSITY AND DYNAMICS OF PROPERTY REGIMES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND EXPLAINS THE ENIGMA OF OPEN ACCESS WITHOUT A TRAGEDY.

SHORTRIDGE JE;ZAITCHIK BF,CHARACTERIZING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS BY LINKING ROBUST DECISION FRAMEWORKS AND UNCERTAIN PROBABILISTIC PROJECTIONS,CLIMATIC CHANGE,CLIM. CHANGE,"THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN THAT AVOIDING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS WILL REQUIRE PROACTIVE ADAPTATION, PARTICULARLY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS WITH LONG LIFESPANS. HOWEVER, ONE CHALLENGE IN ADAPTATION IS THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS GENERATED BY GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCMS). THIS UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME RESEARCHERS USE ENSEMBLES OF GCMS TO GENERATE PROBABILISTIC CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS, BUT THESE PROJECTIONS CAN BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MODEL INDEPENDENCE AND WEIGHTING SCHEMES. BECAUSE OF THESE ISSUES, OTHERS ARGUE THAT ROBUSTNESS-BASED APPROACHES TO CLIMATE ADAPTATION ARE MORE APPROPRIATE, SINCE THEY DO NOT RELY ON A PRECISE PROBABILISTIC REPRESENTATION OF UNCERTAINTY. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PRESENT A NEW APPROACH FOR CHARACTERIZING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS THAT LEVERAGES ROBUST DECISION FRAMEWORKS AND PROBABILISTIC GCM ENSEMBLES. THE SCENARIO DISCOVERY PROCESS IS USED TO SEARCH ACROSS A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPACE AND IDENTIFY CLIMATE SCENARIOS MOST ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEM FAILURE, AND A BAYESIAN STATISTICAL MODEL INFORMED BY GCM PROJECTIONS IS THEN DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF THOSE SCENARIOS. THIS PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT IN THAT IT CAN INCORPORATE DECISION-RELEVANT CLIMATE VARIABLES BEYOND MEAN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION AND ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTY IN PROBABILISTIC ESTIMATES IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY. WE ALSO SUGGEST SEVERAL ADVANCEMENTS BUILDING ON PRIOR APPROACHES TO BAYESIAN MODELING OF CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS TO MAKE THEM MORE BROADLY APPLICABLE.

IDENTIFYING MORE SUSTAINABLE LAND-USE ALTERNATIVES REQUIRES SOLID THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS ON THE CAUSES OF LAND-USE/COVER CHANGES. LAND SYSTEM SCIENCE IS A MATURING FIELD THAT HAS PRODUCED A WEALTH OF METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS ON LAND COVER AND LAND-USE CHANGE, FROM PATTERNS AND PROCESSES TO CAUSES. WE TAKE STOCK OF THIS KNOWLEDGE BY REVIEWING AND SYNTHESIZING THE THEORIES THAT EXPLAIN THE CAUSAL MECHANISMS OF LAND-USE CHANGE, INCLUDING SYSTEMIC LINKAGES BETWEEN DISTANT LAND-USE CHANGES, WITH A FOCUS ON AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY PROCESSES. WE FIRST REVIEW THEORIES EXPLAINING CHANGES IN LAND-USE EXTENT, SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION, DEFORESTATION, FRONTIER DEVELOPMENT, AND LAND ABANDONMENT, AND CHANGES IN LAND-USE INTENSITY, SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND DISINTENSIFICATION. WE THEN SYNTHESIZE THEORIES OF HIGHER-LEVEL LAND SYSTEM CHANGE PROCESSES, FOCUSING ON: (I) LAND-USE SPILLOVERS, INCLUDING LAND SPARING AND REBOUND EFFECTS WITH INTENSIFICATION, LEAKAGE, INDIRECT LAND-USE CHANGE, AND LAND-USE DISPLACEMENT, AND (II) LAND-USE TRANSITIONS, DEFINED AS STRUCTURAL NON-LINEAR CHANGES IN LAND SYSTEMS, INCLUDING FOREST TRANSITIONS.

TWO ESTABLISHED FRAMES ARE IDENTIFIED AS CO-EXISTING AND DOMINANT IN CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION POLICY DISCUSSIONS. THE FIRST FRAME IS IDENTIFIED AS BEGINNING WITH A POST-WORLD WAR II INSTITUTIONALISATION OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR SCIENCE AND R\&D WITH THE PRESUMPTION THAT THIS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO GROWTH AND ADDRESS MARKET FAILURE IN PRIVATE PROVISION OF NEW KNOWLEDGE. THE SECOND FRAME EMERGED IN THE 1980S GLOBALISING WORLD AND ITS EMPHASIS ON COMPETITIVENESS WHICH IS SHAPED BY THE NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF INNOVATION FOR KNOWLEDGE CREATION AND COMMERCIALISATION. STI POLICY FOCUSES ON BUILDING LINKS, CLUSTERS AND NETWORKS, AND ON STIMULATING LEARNING BETWEEN ELEMENTS IN THE SYSTEMS, AND ENABLING ENTREPRENEURSHIP. A THIRD FRAME LINKED TO CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND CALLING FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED AND DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TWO EARLIER FRAMES. TRANSFORMATION REFERS TO SOCIO-TECHNICAL SYSTEM CHANGE AS CONCEPTUALISED IN THE SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS LITERATURE. THE NATURE OF THIS THIRD FRAMING IS EXAMINED WITH THE AIM OF IDENTIFYING ITS KEY FEATURES AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR PROVOKING A RE-EXAMINATION OF THE EARLIER TWO FRAMES. ONE KEY FEATURE IS ITS FOCUS ON EXPERIMENTATION, AND THE ARGUMENT THAT THE GLOBAL SOUTH DOES NOT NEED TO PLAY CATCH-UP TO FOLLOW THE TRANSFORMATION MODEL OF THE GLOBAL NORTH.

LETT.,"WE COMPARE TWO RATIONALES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER UNCERTAINTY: CONTROL AND RESILIENCE. THE FIRST FOCUSES AT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, THE SECOND AT SYSTEM CAPACITY TO COPE WITH CHANGE. THE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT PROMOTE THEIR OWN LEGITIMACY, BUT UNDERTAKE LITTLE EFFORT TO TRANSCEND THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE. THOUGH, DIFFERENT SCHOLARS HAVE POINTED AT THE NECESSITY OF COMBINING CONTROL AND RESILIENCE FOR MANAGING A SYSTEM. WE REVIEW THE LITERATURE ON CONTROL AND RESILIENCE, SYNTHESIZE THE WORK IN THESE FIELDS INTO ONE COHERENT CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND REFLECT ON THE QUESTION WHETHER CONTROL AND RESILIENCE STRATEGIES CAN BE RECONCILED OR WHETHER INEVITABLE TRADE-OFFS ARE TO BE MADE. BASED ON A LITERATURE REVIEW, WE DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK CONTRASTING BOTH RATIONALES THROUGH THEIR PREFERRED (CONTRARY) SYSTEM ATTRIBUTES. NEXT, WE DISCUSS THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF THESE SYSTEM PROPERTIES FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT. POLICIES WILL GENERALLY REFLECT ELEMENTS OF BOTH CONTROL AND RESILIENCE. THERE WILL BE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN PREFERRED SYSTEM ATTRIBUTES, WHERE DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE RESTRICTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF POSSIBLE CONTROL (AND VICE VERSA). THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK INTRODUCED PROVIDES A `LANGUAGE' FOR CONTRASTING AND POSSIBLY (PARTLY) RECONCILING THE CONTROL AND RESILIENCE RATIONALES.

EVANS A,POLITICISING INEQUALITY: THE POWER OF IDEAS,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,WORLD DEV.,"A CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGE IS INEQUALITY. THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES WHY IDEAS MATTER, AND HOW THEY CAN CHANGE OVER TIME. INEQUALITIES ARE REINFORCED WHEN THEY ARE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. BUT THIS CAN BE DISRUPTED WHEN MARGINALISED PEOPLE GAIN SELF-ESTEEM, CHALLENGE HITHERTO UNQUESTIONED INEQUALITIES, AND GAIN CONFIDENCE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF SOCIAL CHANGE. SLOWLY AND INCREMENTALLY, SOCIAL MOBILISATION CAN CATALYSE GREATER GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS IS ILLUSTRATED WITH ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH FROM LATIN AMERICA, WHERE INCOME INEQUALITY HAS RECENTLY DECLINED. CLEARLY, HOWEVER, NO SINGLE PAPER CAN PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT OF POLITICAL CHANGE IN AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE REGION. BY HIGHLIGHTING SOME WAYS IN WHICH IDEAS MATTER (AND THE LIMITATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES ABOUT INCREASED FISCAL SPACE AND DEMOCRATISATION), THIS PAPER MERELY SEEKS TO PERSUADE POLITICAL ECONOMISTS TO GO BEYOND `INCENTIVES'.

SCI.,"THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE SOCIO-TECHNICAL IMAGINARIES SURROUNDING INFRASTRUCTURES OF COAL MINING AND COAL COMBUSTION IN POLAND. CONTEMPORARY POLICY MAKERS IN POLAND MOBILISE A NATIONAL IMAGINARY INHERITED FROM COMMUNIST TIMES - ENCAPSULATED IN THE SLOGAN `POLAND STANDS ON COAL' - THAT FUSES INFRASTRUCTURES OF COAL EXTRACTION AND COMBUSTION WITH THE FATE OF THE NATION. THIS SOCIO-TECHNICAL IMAGINARY PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR COAL FUTURES, EVEN IN THE FACE OF CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE FOR DOMESTIC RESOURCE DEPLETION, POOR REGIONAL AIR QUALITY, AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. TO EXAMINE THIS PROCESS, THE PAPER BRINGS RESEARCH ON SOCIO-TECHNICAL IMAGINARIES INTO CONVERSATION WITH WORK ON RESOURCE MATERIALITIES. IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW CERTAIN MATERIALITIES OF COAL (ABUNDANCE, ACCESSIBILITY, ENERGY DENSITY, LOCATION) WERE INTEGRAL TO THE EMERGENCE OF A NATIONAL SOCIO-TECHNICAL IMAGINARY OF MODERNISATION VIA COAL, AND HOW OTHER MATERIALITIES (DECLINING RESOURCE QUALITY, EFFECTS OF EMISSIONS ON RESPIRATORY HEALTH, COAL AS CO2-IN-WAITING) NOW COLLIDE WITH THE POLITICAL STRATEGIES OF A GOVERNMENT DETERMINED TO REASSERT `BLACK GOLD' AS A BEDROCK OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR YEARS TO COME.

SCI.,"THIS STUDY DEVELOPS RESEARCH ON SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, POLITICAL COALITIONS, AND SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS WITH A MULTI-COALITION PERSPECTIVE. THE PERSPECTIVE BEGINS WITH A TYPOLOGY OF COALITIONS BASED ON TWO PAIRS OF GOALS-GENERAL SOCIETAL CHANGE VERSUS THE SOCIOTECHNICAL TRANSITION OF AN INDUSTRY OR TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM, AND SUNRISING VERSUS SUNSETTING OF SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES. MAPPING THE DIVERSITY OF ENERGY-TRANSITION COALITIONS MAKES IT POSSIBLE NOT ONLY TO IDENTIFY THE VARIOUS WINGS OF A BROADER INDUSTRIAL TRANSITION MOVEMENT IN A SPECIFIED TIME AND PLACE BUT ALSO TO SHOW THE DYNAMICS OF HOW COALITIONS INTERACT AND CHANGE OVER TIME. DRAWING ON CASE STUDIES OF FOUR ENERGY-TRANSITION COALITIONS IN NEW YORK STATE THAT APPROXIMATE THE FOUR IDEAL TYPES, THE STUDY SHOWS DIFFERENCES IN THE GOALS, STRATEGIES, ORGANIZATIONAL COMPOSITION, AND FRAMES OF THE COALITIONS. THE STUDY THEN SHOWS THE MECHANISMS THAT ENABLE INTEGRATION ACROSS COALITIONS, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF BRIDGE BROKERS AND NEW FRAMES. AS THE NETWORKS OF THE ENERGY-TRANSITION COALITIONS BECOME MORE CONNECTED, THE ORGANIZATIONS MAKE USE OF A WIDER SET OF FRAMES, INCLUDING THE NEWER FRAME OF ENERGY DEMOCRACY.

IT TAKES A CRITICAL STANCE ON THE IMPLICIT METHODOLOGICAL NATIONALISM IN TRANSITION STUDIES' SOCIO-TECHNICAL REGIME CONCEPT AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE `GLOBAL' REGIME PERSPECTIVE THAT EMBRACES THE INCREASINGLY MULTI-SCALAR ACTOR NETWORKS AND INSTITUTIONAL RATIONALITIES, WHICH INFLUENCE TRANSITION DYNAMICS BEYOND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL BORDERS. BY DRAWING ON GLOBALIZATION THEORIES FROM SOCIOLOGY AND HUMAN GEOGRAPHY, WE SHOW THAT SOCIO-TECHNICAL SYSTEMS OFTEN DEVELOP INSTITUTIONAL RATIONALITIES THAT ARE DIFFUSED VIA INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS AND THUS BECOME INFLUENTIAL IN VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. IN SO DOING, WE SHED LIGHT ON THE MULTI-SCALAR INTERRELATEDNESS OF INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES AND ACTORS IN SOCIO-TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND ELABORATE ON THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF TRANSITION DYNAMICS. THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES THIS WITH THE CASE STUDY OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL TRANSITION IN THE CHINESE WASTEWATER SECTOR. RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT KEY DECISIONS ON WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION WERE NOT ONLY INFLUENCED BY PATH-DEPENDENCIES STEMMING FROM CHINA'S NATIONAL CONTEXT, BUT EQUALLY (OR EVEN MORE CRITICALLY) BY THE DOMINANT RATIONALITY OF THE WATER SECTOR'S GLOBAL SOCIO-TECHNICAL REGIME.

THIS PAPER AIMS TO CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR A DISCUSSION WITHIN THE SES RESEARCH COMMUNITY ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE USE OF THE TERM TIPPING POINT, ESPECIALLY THE RELATIVELY NOVEL TERM `SOCIAL TIPPING POINT.' WE REVIEW EXISTING LITERATURE ON TIPPING POINTS AND SIMILAR CONCEPTS (E.G.

THESE PRINCIPLES CAN HELP IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE METHODS AND APPROACHES FOR STUDYING SES. WE DISCUSS THREE MAIN IMPLICATIONS OF STUDYING AND ENGAGING WITH SES AS CAS. FIRST, THERE NEEDS TO BE A SHIFT IN FOCUS WHEN STUDYING THE DYNAMICS AND INTERACTIONS IN SES, TO BETTER CAPTURE THE NATURE OF THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES THAT CHARACTERIZE SES BEHAVIOR. SECOND, REALIZING THAT THE NATURE OF THE INTERTWINED SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RELATIONS IS COMPLEX HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR HOW WE CHOOSE METHODS AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES FOR OBSERVING AND STUDYING SES INTERACTIONS.

BIGGS R;PETERSON GD;ROCHA JC,THE REGIME SHIFTS DATABASE: A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING REGIME SHIFTS IN SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,ECOL. SOC.,"REGIME SHIFTS, I.E., LARGE, PERSISTENT, AND USUALLY UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, CAN HAVE MAJOR IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ON HUMAN WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, THE VULNERABILITY OF DIFFERENT REGIONS TO VARIOUS REGIME SHIFTS IS LARGELY UNKNOWN BECAUSE EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF REGIME SHIFTS IN DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS AND PARTS OF THE WORLD IS SCATTERED AND HIGHLY UNEVEN. FURTHERMORE, RESEARCH TENDS TO FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL REGIME SHIFTS RATHER THAN COMPARISONS ACROSS REGIME SHIFTS, LIMITING THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTIFYING COMMON DRIVERS THAT COULD REDUCE THE RISK OF MULTIPLE REGIME SHIFTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. HERE, WE INTRODUCE THE REGIME SHIFTS DATABASE, AN OPEN-ACCESS DATABASE THAT SYSTEMATICALLY SYNTHESIZES INFORMATION ON SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL REGIME SHIFTS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF SYSTEMS USING A CONSISTENT, COMPARATIVE FRAMEWORK, PROVIDING A WIDE-RANGING INFORMATION RESOURCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING, ASSESSMENT, RESEARCH, AND TEACHING INITIATIVES. THE DATABASE CURRENTLY CONTAINS 28 GENERIC TYPES OF REGIME SHIFTS AND > 300 SPECIFIC CASE STUDIES. EACH ENTRY PROVIDES A LITERATURE-BASED SYNTHESIS OF THE KEY DRIVERS AND FEEDBACKS UNDERLYING THE REGIME SHIFT, AS WELL AS IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND HUMAN WELL-BEING, AND POSSIBLE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. ACROSS THE 28 REGIME SHIFTS, CLIMATE CHANGE AND AGRICULTURE-RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE THE MOST PROMINENT AMONG A WIDE RANGE OF DRIVERS. BIODIVERSITY, FISHERIES, AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY WIDELY AFFECTED, AS ARE KEY ASPECTS OF HUMAN WELL-BEING, INCLUDING LIVELIHOODS, FOOD AND NUTRITION, AND AN ARRAY OF CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

(2013) REDEFINE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS ``DEVELOPMENT THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT WHILE SAFEGUARDING EARTH'S LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM, ON WHICH THE WELFARE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS DEPEND. WE RECOMMEND THIS AS THE END GOAL THAT THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) SHOULD STRIVE TO ACHIEVE. INTEGRATION ACROSS THE SDGS IS LESS THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED FROM A SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE. EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SDGS WILL REQUIRE STATES TO ATTEND TO TRADE-OFFS AND OVERLAPS. WE ARGUE THAT CONTINUOUS FAILURE TO ADDRESS INTEGRATION WITHIN THE SDGS WILL JEOPARDIZE REALIZATION OF THIS ULTIMATE END GOAL. THEREFORE, WE ADOPT A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO IDENTIFY GAPS AND CONNECTIONS ACROSS THE GOALS AND TARGETS OF THE SDGS AS WELL AS LEVERAGE POINTS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. WE TRIANGULATE ACROSS METHODS OF CRITICAL ANALYSIS, CONCEPTUAL MODELING, AND KEYWORD NETWORK ANALYSIS TO DRAW OUT SEVEN ``OVERARCHING DIRECTIONS THAT COULD PROVIDE A PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK TO ENHANCE EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SDGS. OUR RESULTS IDENTIFY MAIN GAPS AS EXCLUSION OF KEY ACTORS (E.G., CORPORATIONS) AND ISSUES (E.G., INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY AND POPULATION), INADEQUATE RECONCILIATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH MAINTAINING THE EARTH SYSTEM, AND DEFICIENT CONSIDERATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW. CONCEPTUAL MAPPING IDENTIFIES EDUCATION AND INNOVATION, GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION, SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION, AND ADDRESSING THE KEY DRIVERS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS KEY LEVERAGE POINTS. THE KEYWORD ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS GREATER INTEGRATION WITHIN THE SDGS THAN WHAT APPEARS AT FACE VALUE. KEYWORDS ``ACCESS, ``WOMEN, ``RESOURCES,AND ``FINANCE FEATURE ACROSS THE SDGS AND PROVIDE FURTHER LEVERAGE POINTS. TARGETING THESE ISSUES WILL FACILITATE REALIZATION OF A HIGH PROPORTION OF SDGS AND CORRESPONDINGLY COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONAL IMPACT ON EFFECTIVE SDG IMPLEMENTATION.

SOC.,"INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT IS CENTRAL TO THE PROCESSES THAT ABATE AND PRODUCE VULNERABILITIES IN CITIES. URBAN ACTORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH POWER AND AUTHORITY, PERCEIVE AND INTERPRET VULNERABILITY AND DECIDE WHEN AND HOW TO ADAPT. WHEN CITY MANAGERS USE INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE URBAN RISK IN THE COMPLEX, INTERCONNECTED CITY SYSTEM, NEW FRAGILITIES ARE INTRODUCED BECAUSE OF INHERENT SYSTEM FEEDBACKS. WE TRACE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SYSTEM DYNAMICS AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES OVER 700 YEARS OF MEXICO CITY'S ADAPTATIONS TO WATER RISKS, FOCUSING ON THE DECISION CYCLES OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS (IN THIS CASE, GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES). WE BRING TOGETHER TWO LENSES IN EXAMINING THIS HISTORY: ROBUSTNESS-VULNERABILITY TRADE-OFFS TO EXPLAIN THE EVOLUTION OF SYSTEMIC RISK DYNAMICS MEDIATED BY FEEDBACK CONTROL, AND ADAPTATION PATHWAYS TO FOCUS ON THE EVOLUTION OF DECISION CYCLES THAT MOTIVATE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. DRAWING FROM HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS, ARCHEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE, AND ORIGINAL RESEARCH ON WATER, ENGINEERING, AND CULTURAL HISTORY, WE EXAMINE ADAPTATION PATHWAYS OF HUMANS SETTLEMENT, WATER SUPPLY, AND FLOOD RISK. MEXICO CITY'S HISTORY REVEALS INSIGHTS THAT EXPAND THE THEORY OF COUPLED INFRASTRUCTURE AND LESSONS SALIENT TO CONTEMPORARY URBAN RISK MANAGEMENT: (1) ADAPTING BY SPATIALLY EXTERNALIZING RISKS CAN BACKFIRE: AS CITIES EXPAND, SUCH RISKS BECOME ENDOGENOUS, (2) OVER TIME, ADAPTATION PATHWAYS INITIATED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC RISKS MAY BEGIN TO INTERSECT, CREATING COMPLEX TRADE-OFFS IN RISK MANAGEMENT, AND (3) CITY AUTHORITIES ARE AGENTS OF RISK PRODUCTION: EVEN IN THE FACE OF NEW EXOGENOUS RISKS (CLIMATE CHANGE), ACKNOWLEDGING AND MANAGING RISKS PRODUCED ENDOGENOUSLY MAY PROVE MORE ADAPTIVE.

HAIDER LJ;BOONSTRA WJ;PETERSON GD;SCHLUTER M,TRAPS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL AREAS: A REVIEW,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,WORLD DEV.,"THE CONCEPT OF A POVERTY TRAP-COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AS A SELF-REINFORCING SITUATION BENEATH AN ASSET THRESHOLD-HAS BEEN VERY INFLUENTIAL IN DESCRIBING THE PERSISTENCE OF POVERTY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POVERTY AND SUSTAINABILITY. ALTHOUGH TRAPS, AND THE DYNAMICS THAT LEAD TO TRAPS, ARE DEFINED AND USED DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, THE CONCEPT OF A POVERTY TRAP HAS BEEN MOST POWERFULLY SHAPED BY WORK IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS. THIS PERSPECTIVE IS OFTEN CONSTRAINING BECAUSE, AS MANY STUDIES SHOW, POVERTY ARISES FROM COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT ARE RARELY CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS. A MORE INTEGRATED UNDERSTANDING OF POVERTY TRAPS CAN HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN PERSISTENT POVERTY AND KEY SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS, FACILITATING MORE EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF EXISTING TRAP CONCEPTUALIZATIONS IN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, AND TO ASSESS THE CHARACTERISTICS AND MECHANISMS THAT ARE USED TO EXPLAIN POVERTY TRAPS IN RURAL CONTEXTS, THEREBY BROADENING THE TRAPS CONCEPT TO BETTER ACCOUNT FOR SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS. COMPLEMENTARITIES AND TENSIONS AMONG DIFFERENT DISCIPLINARY, PERSPECTIVES ON TRAPS ARE IDENTIFIED, AND OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF TRAPS SHARE A SET OF COMMON CHARACTERISTICS: PERSISTENCE, UNDESIRABILITY, AND SELF-REINFORCEMENT. YET THESE MINIMUM CONDITIONS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TRAP DYNAMICS ARISE FROM COMPLEX SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS. TO BROADEN THE UTILITY OF THE CONCEPT WE PROPOSE A MORE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED DEFINITION OF TRAPS THAT INCLUDES FOUR ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS: CROSS-SCALE INTERACTIONS, PATH DEPENDENCIES, THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL DRIVERS, AND SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. INCLUDING THESE WIDER DIMENSIONS OF TRAP DYNAMICS WOULD HELP TO BETTER ACCOUNT FOR THE DIVERSE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL FEEDBACKS THAT PRODUCE AND MAINTAIN POVERTY TRAPS, AND COULD STRENGTHEN STRATEGIES TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY IN A MORE INTEGRATED WAY.

THE FIELD OF TRANSITION STUDIES HAS BEEN CRITICALLY INTERROGATED FOR UNDERMINING THE ROLE OF POWER, WHICH HAS INSPIRED VARIOUS ENDEAVOURS TO THEORIZE POWER AND AGENCY IN TRANSITIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE POWER-IN-TRANSITION FRAMEWORK (POINT), WHICH IS DEVELOPED AS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO ANALYSE POWER AND (DIS)EMPOWERMENT IN TRANSFORMATIVE SOCIAL CHANGE, INTEGRATING TRANSITION CONCEPTS AND MULTIPLE POWER AND EMPOWERMENT THEORIES. THE FIRST SECTION INTRODUCES TRANSITIONS STUDIES AND DISCUSSES ITS STATE-OF-THE-ART REGARDING POWER. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A TYPOLOGY OF POWER RELATIONS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF POWER (REINFORCIVE, INNOVATIVE, TRANSFORMATIVE). THESE NOTIONS ARE THEN USED TO REFRAME TRANSITION CONCEPTS, IN PARTICULAR THE MULTI-LEVEL PERSPECTIVE, IN TERMS OF POWER DYNAMICS. THE CRITICAL CHALLENGES OF (DIS)EMPOWERMENT AND UNINTENDED POWER IMPLICATIONS OF DISCOURSES ON AND POLICIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS' ARE DISCUSSED.

EMPIRICAL STUDIES ADDRESSING THE CONTRIBUTION OF SOCIAL LEARNING TO RESILIENCE ARE SCARCE HOWEVER, AND DO NOT PROVIDE DIRECT EVIDENCE BUT INFER THIS CONTRIBUTION FROM THE IMPACTS OF SOCIAL LEARNING ON SYSTEM GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT. THESE IMPACTS ARE FOUND MORE FREQUENTLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAN AT HIGHER, REGIONAL OR NATIONAL LEVELS, PROBABLY DEPENDING ON THE OVERLAP BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS IN SOCIAL LEARNING AND ACTORS IN GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AT HIGHER LEVELS A CONNECTION BETWEEN SOCIAL LEARNING AND POLICY CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH BRIDGING ACTORS OR ORGANIZATIONS, AND VERTICAL LINKAGES BETWEEN GOVERNANCE LEVELS.

THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL OF THE CONCEPT OF `ROLES' FROM SOCIAL INTERACTION RESEARCH. THE ROLE CONCEPT IS OPERATIONALIZED FOR TRANSITION RESEARCH TO ALLOW THE ANALYSIS OF (CHANGING) ROLES AND RELATIONS BETWEEN ACTOR ROLES AS INDICATIVE OF CHANGES IN THE SOCIAL FABRIC AND SHARED VALUES, NORMS AND BELIEFS. IT ALSO ALLOWS CONSIDERING THE USE OF ROLES AS A TRANSITION GOVERNANCE INTERVENTION.

BY DRAWING ON EXISTING INNOVATION SYSTEM CONCEPTS AND RECENT ELABORATIONS ON THE GLOBALIZATION OF INNOVATION, WE DEVELOP A MULTI-SCALAR CONCEPTUALIZATION OF INNOVATION SYSTEMS. TWO KEY MECHANISMS ARE INTRODUCED AND ELABORATED: THE GENERATION OF RESOURCES IN MULTI-LOCATIONAL SUBSYSTEMS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STRUCTURAL COUPLINGS AMONG THEM IN A GLOBAL INNOVATION SYSTEM (GIS). BASED ON THIS CONCEPTUALIZATION, WE INTRODUCE A TYPOLOGY OF FOUR GENERIC GIS CONFIGURATIONS, BUILDING ON THE INNOVATION MODE AND VALUATION SYSTEM IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRY TYPES. THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK IS ILLUSTRATED WITH INSIGHTS FROM FOUR EMERGING CLEAN-TECH INDUSTRIES.

TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS DILEMMA, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND HUMAN WELL-BEING, BEYOND ITS ECONOMIC DIMENSION, NEEDS TO BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD. THIS PAPER AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EMERGING KNOWLEDGE BASE, BY EXAMINING THIS RELATIONSHIP USING A PROXY FOR HUMAN WELL-BEING THAT ALSO CONSIDERS ITS ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN EFFORTS TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGHER COLLECTIVE WELL-BEING AND THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE STABILIZATION. TO THIS END, IT PROVIDES ESTIMATES OF THE ADDITIONAL ENERGY NEEDED AND ITS ASSOCIATED CARBON EMISSIONS UNDER DIFFERENT CLIMATE SCENARIOS, AND COMPARES THEM WITH EXISTING CARBON BUDGETS.

SEAFOOD IS A HIGHLY TRADED AND SOUGHT AFTER COMMODITY ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON HEALTHY MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. A GLOBAL TREND OF WILD STOCKS BEING OVERFISHED AND IN DECLINE, AS WELL AS MULTIPLE SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH A RAPID GROWTH OF AQUACULTURE, REPRESENT KEY CONCERNS IN RELATION TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. EXISTING EFFORTS AIMED TO IMPROVE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF SEAFOOD PRODUCTION HAVE GENERATED IMPORTANT PROGRESS, PRIMARILY AT THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS, BUT HAVE YET TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE GLOBAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCEAN. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN ENABLING TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE, AND THEREBY CONTRIBUTES TO ADVANCING THE LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF LARGE-SCALE PRIVATE ACTORS WITHIN THE SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE LITERATURE. WE DESCRIBE HOW WE ENGAGED WITH LARGE SEAFOOD PRODUCERS TO COPRODUCE A GLOBAL SCIENCE-BUSINESS INITIATIVE FOR OCEAN STEWARDSHIP. WE SUGGEST THAT THIS INITIATIVE IS IMPROVING THE PROSPECTS FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE BY PROVIDING NOVEL LINKS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND BUSINESS, BETWEEN WILD-CAPTURE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE, AND ACROSS GEOGRAPHICAL SPACE.

WE PRESENT AN EMPIRICAL DOCUMENT-BY-DOCUMENT TEXTUAL CONTENT ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF 187 CLIMATE CHANGE COMMUNICATIONS FROM EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING PEER-REVIEWED AND NON-PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, INTERNAL COMPANY DOCUMENTS, AND PAID, EDITORIAL-STYLE ADVERTISEMENTS ('ADVERTORIALS') IN THE NEW YORK TIMES. WE EXAMINE WHETHER THESE COMMUNICATIONS SENT CONSISTENT MESSAGES ABOUT THE STATE OF CLIMATE SCIENCE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS-SPECIFICALLY, WE COMPARE THEIR POSITIONS ON CLIMATE CHANGE AS REAL, HUMAN-CAUSED, SERIOUS, AND SOLVABLE. IN ALL FOUR CASES, WE FIND THAT AS DOCUMENTS BECOME MORE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE, THEY INCREASINGLY COMMUNICATE DOUBT. THIS DISCREPANCY IS MOST PRONOUNCED BETWEEN ADVERTORIALS AND ALL OTHER DOCUMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ACCOUNTING FOR EXPRESSIONS OF REASONABLE DOUBT, 83\% OF PEER-REVIEWED PAPERS AND 80\% OF INTERNAL DOCUMENTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND HUMAN-CAUSED, YET ONLY 12\% OF ADVERTORIALS DO SO, WITH 81\% INSTEAD EXPRESSING DOUBT. WE CONCLUDE THAT EXXONMOBIL CONTRIBUTED TO ADVANCING CLIMATE SCIENCE-BY WAY OF ITS SCIENTISTS' ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS-BUT PROMOTED DOUBT ABOUT IT IN ADVERTORIALS. GIVEN THIS DISCREPANCY, WE CONCLUDE THAT EXXONMOBIL MISLED THE PUBLIC. OUR CONTENT ANALYSIS ALSO EXAMINES EXXONMOBIL'S DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS OF STRANDED FOSSIL FUEL ASSETS.

MORRISON TH,EVOLVING POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,PROC. NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.,"A GROWING FIELD OF SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE EXAMINES HOW ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSFORMED THROUGH POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, MANY STUDIES ARE ONLY SNAPSHOT ANALYSES OF THE INITIAL DESIGN OR THE EMERGENT STRUCTURE OF POLYCENTRIC REGIMES. THERE IS LESS SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE LONGITUDINAL ROBUSTNESS OF POLYCENTRIC REGIMES. THE PROBLEM OF ROBUSTNESS IS APPROACHED BY FOCUSING NOT ONLY ON THE STRUCTURE OF A REGIME BUT ALSO ON ITS CONTEXT AND EFFECTIVENESS. THESE DIMENSIONS ARE EXAMINED THROUGH A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF (GBR) GOVERNANCE REGIME, DRAWING ON IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS AND DEMOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC, AND EMPLOYMENT DATA, AS WELL AS ORGANIZATIONAL RECORDS AND PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION. BETWEEN 1975 AND 2011, THE GBR REGIME EVOLVED INTO A ROBUST POLYCENTRIC STRUCTURE AS EVIDENT IN AN ESTABLISHED SET OF MULTIACTOR, MULTILEVEL ARRANGEMENTS ADDRESSING MARINE, TERRESTRIAL, AND GLOBAL THREATS. HOWEVER, FROM 2005 ONWARD, MULTISCALE DRIVERS PRECIPITATED AT LEAST 10 TYPES OF REGIME CHANGE, RANGING FROM CONTEXTUAL CHANGE THAT ENCOURAGED REGIME DRIFT TO DELIBERATE CHANGES THAT THREATENED REGIME CONVERSION. MORE RECENTLY, REGIME REALIGNMENT ALSO HAS OCCURRED IN RESPONSE TO STEERING BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SHOCKS SUCH AS THE 2016 MASS CORAL-BLEACHING EVENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT STRUCTURAL DENSITY AND STABILITY IN A GOVERNANCE REGIME CAN COEXIST WITH MAJOR CHANGES IN THAT REGIME'S CONTEXT AND EFFECTIVENESS. CLEAR ANALYSIS OF THE VULNERABILITY OF POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE TO BOTH DIMINISHING EFFECTIVENESS AND THE MASKING EFFECTS OF INCREASING COMPLEXITY PROVIDES SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE AND GOVERNANCE ACTORS WITH A STRONGER BASIS TO UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND TO REGIME CHANGE.",ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE; ROBUSTNESS; NETWORKS; CLIMATE CHANGE,CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY CHANGE; REGIMES; SYSTEMS; STRATEGIES; AUSTRALIA; KNOWLEDGE; COMMONS; COMPLEX; CONTEXT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,45,"MORRISON, TH (REPRINT AUTHOR), JAMES COOK UNIV, AUSTRALIAN RES COUNCIL, CTR EXCELLENCE CORAL REEF STUDIES, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA.;MORRISON, TIFFANY H., JAMES COOK UNIV, AUSTRALIAN RES COUNCIL, CTR EXCELLENCE CORAL REEF STUDIES, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA.",10.1073/PNAS.1620830114,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",NA,NA,AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL [H6149],"THE AUTHOR THANKS CINDY HUCHERY AND MISSAKA HETTIARARCHCHI FOR ASSISTING WITH THE LITERATURE REVIEW, DOCUMENTARY REVIEW, AND ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF THE DATA; TERRY HUGHES, JON DAY, MARCUS LANE, GRAEME CUMMING, AND PIP COHEN FOR THEIR HELPFUL COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS; AND PROJECT INTERVIEWEES AND KEY INFORMANTS.

ROSENBLOOM D,PATHWAYS: AN EMERGING CONCEPT FOR THE THEORY AND GOVERNANCE OF LOW-CARBON TRANSITIONS,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,GLOB. ENVIRON. CHANGE-HUMAN POLICY DIMENS.,"THE CONCEPT OF ``PATHWAYS HAS INCREASINGLY COME TO FRAME THE CHALLENGE OF TRANSITIONING TO LOW-CARBON SOCIETIES. IT ALSO SHOWS PROMISE AS A BRIDGING CONCEPT, ENCOURAGING CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE AMONG THE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND CONSTITUENCIES EVOKING ITS USE. HOWEVER, ITS INTERPRETATIONS AND ATTRIBUTES ARE RARELY EXPLICIT AND HAVE YET TO BE SUBJECT TO SERIOUS SCRUTINY. THIS RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR BOTH THEORY AND GOVERNANCE AS THE WAY IN WHICH A PROBLEM IS FRAMED SHAPES HOW IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND ADDRESSED, STRUCTURING THE POSSIBILITIES CONSIDERED AND PRIVILEGING CERTAIN RESPONSES. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE CONCEPT OF PATHWAYS IN THE CONTEXT OF LOW-CARBON TRANSITIONS, EXPOSING ITS CONCEPTIONS, MATURATION, AND IMPLICATIONS. BASED ON A SURVEY OF THE RELEVANT CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION LITERATURE, THIS ANALYSIS UNCOVERS THREE CORE CONCEPTIONS OF PATHWAYS IN THE CONTEXT OF LOW-CARBON TRANSITIONS: (1) BIOPHYSICAL, (2) TECHNO-ECONOMIC, AND (3) SOCIO-TECHNICAL. CONSTITUTED BY DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND APPROACHES, EACH OF THESE THREE CORE CONCEPTIONS EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT YET INTERCONNECTED DIMENSIONS OF THE DECARBONIZATION CHALLENGE. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS TO SEVERAL KEY ATTRIBUTES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF PATHWAYS. YET, WHILE THE CONCEPT MAY POSSESS A VARIETY OF FEATURES THAT RECOMMEND ITS USE AS A CRITICAL PROBLEM FRAME FOR LOW-CARBON TRANSITIONS, IT ALSO RAISES ISSUES THAT SUGGEST A NEED FOR FURTHER REFLEXIVITY. IF THE CONCEPT IS CAST TOO STRONGLY IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL CORE CONCEPTIONS, THERE MAY BE A TENDENCY TO EMPHASIZE CERTAIN DYNAMICS WHILE PAYING SOMEWHAT LESS ATTENTION TO OTHERS, INADVERTENTLY DIMINISHING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DECARBONIZATION CHALLENGE. BEYOND THIS, THERE ARE OTHER FACETS OF THE CONCEPT THAT HAVE TO DATE RECEIVED MORE LIMITED ATTENTION, INCLUDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHOICES AT CRITICAL JUNCTURES AND THE EVOLVING CHARACTER OF SOCIAL PRACTICES. SO, THERE IS ROOM FOR THE CONCEPT OF PATHWAYS TO ENGAGE MORE FULLY WITH THE RANGE OF COMPLEXITIES EMBODIED BY LOW CARBON TRANSITIONS. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER LTD.

TO HIGHLIGHT SALIENT FEATURES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE IPCC BUT THAT OFFER LESSONS FOR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONDUCT GEAS, WE INCLUDE CASE STUDIES ON THE POLITICS OF CLIMATE DENIALISM, THE USE OF GEOENGINEERING IN MITIGATION SCENARIOS, AND THE LINKS BETWEEN ADAPTIVE CAPACITY, ADAPTATION, AND GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT. WE CONCLUDE WITH A DISCUSSION OF INSTITUTIONAL REFLEXIVITY.

USING THE OCEAN SUSTAINABLY REQUIRES OVERCOMING MANY FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES: OVERFISHING, CLIMATE CHANGE, OCEAN ACIDIFICATION, AND POLLUTION. DESPITE GLOOMY FORECASTS, THERE IS REASON FOR HOPE. NEW TOOLS, PRACTICES, AND PARTNERSHIPS ARE BEGINNING TO TRANSFORM LOCAL FISHERIES, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, AND MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING. THE CHALLENGE IS TO BRING THEM TO A GLOBAL SCALE. WE DISSECT RECENT SUCCESSES USING A COMPLEX ADAPTIVE-SYSTEMS (CAS) FRAMEWORK, WHICH ACKNOWLEDGES THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. UNDERSTANDING HOW POLICIES AND PRACTICES CHANGE THE FEEDBACKS IN CASS BY ALTERING THE BEHAVIOR OF DIFFERENT SYSTEM COMPONENTS IS CRITICAL FOR BUILDING ROBUST, SUSTAINABLE STATES WITH FAVORABLE EMERGENT PROPERTIES. OUR REVIEW REVEALS THAT ALTERING INCENTIVES-EITHER ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL NORMS, OR BOTH-CAN ACHIEVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. FOR EXAMPLE, INTRODUCTION OF WELL-DESIGNED RIGHTS-BASED OR SECURE-ACCESS FISHERIES AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE ACCOUNTING SHIFTS ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO ALIGN CONSERVATION AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS. MODIFYING SOCIAL NORMS CAN CREATE CONDITIONS THAT INCENTIVIZE A COMPANY, COUNTRY, OR INDIVIDUAL TO FISH SUSTAINABLY, CURB ILLEGAL FISHING, OR CREATE LARGE MARINE RESERVES AS STEPS TO ENHANCE REPUTATION OR SELF-IMAGE. IN EACH EXAMPLE, THE FEEDBACKS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL ACTORS AND EMERGENT SYSTEM PROPERTIES WERE ALTERED, TRIGGERING A TRANSITION FROM A VICIOUS TO A VIRTUOUS CYCLE. WE SUGGEST THAT EVALUATING CONSERVATION TOOLS BY THEIR ABILITY TO ALIGN INCENTIVES OF ACTORS WITH BROADER GOALS OF SUSTAINABILITY IS AN UNDERUSED APPROACH THAT CAN PROVIDE A PATHWAY TOWARD SCALING SUSTAINABILITY SUCCESSES.

IT IS ARGUED THAT THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSES IN TRANSITION STUDIES LACK PRECISION WHEN IT COMES TO DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES AND LEVELS OF ACTORS. IN RESPONSE, A MULTI-ACTOR PERSPECTIVE (MAP) IS DEVELOPED, WHICH DISTINGUISHES AMONG FOUR SECTORS (STATE, MARKET, COMMUNITY, THIRD SECTOR), AND BETWEEN ACTORS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AGGREGATION: (1) SECTORS, (2) ORGANIZATIONAL ACTORS, AND (3) INDIVIDUAL ACTORS.

THERE IS WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND POVERTY-VULNERABILITY DYNAMICS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE RISK MANAGEMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION INVESTMENTS. THIS IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE LATENT NATURE OF ADAPTIVE CAPACITIES, FREQUENT LACK OF BASELINE DATA, AND THE NEED FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION STUDIES. HERE WE RESPOND TO THESE CHALLENGES BY ANALYZING HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL DATA IN NORTHEAST BRAZIL TO COMPARE DROUGHT EVENTS 14 YEARS APART. IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN DROUGHTS, THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED AN AGGRESSIVE ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES FINANCIAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. POVERTY DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT THE EXPECTED REDUCTION IN VULNERABILITY DID NOT OCCUR, IN PART BECAUSE THE HOUSEHOLDS WERE NOT INVESTING IN RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. OUR FINDINGS COMPLEMENT OTHER RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT HOUSEHOLDS MAKE RATIONAL DECISIONS THAT MAY NOT CORRESPOND WITH POLICYMAKER EXPECTATIONS. WE EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR COMPLEMENTARY INVESTMENTS TO HELP CHANNEL INCREASED HOUSEHOLD WEALTH INTO RISK REDUCTION, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR ITSELF CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE THE PUBLIC FUNCTIONS OF RISK MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THE SOCIAL COST OF CLIMATIC RISK IS HIGH.",ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; DROUGHT; RISK,SUSTAINABLE ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; DROUGHT; CAPACITY; CEARA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"NELSON, DR (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT ANTHROPOL, 250A BALDWIN HALL, ATHENS, GA 30606 USA.;NELSON, DONALD R., UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT ANTHROPOL, 250A BALDWIN HALL, ATHENS, GA 30606 USA.;LEMOS, MARIA CARMEN, LO, YUN-JIA, UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH NAT RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM, 440 CHURCH ST, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.;EAKIN, HALLIE, ARIZONA STATE UNIV, SCH SUSTAINABIL, POB 875502, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA.",10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/094011,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",094011,NA,"NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION-NOAA'S PROGRAM ON ECONOMICS AND HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF GLOBAL CHANGE [NA76GP0385]; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [SES 1061930, SES-1061966]","FUNDING FOR 1998 DATA COLLECTION WAS PROVIDED BY NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION-NOAA'S PROGRAM ON ECONOMICS AND HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF GLOBAL CHANGE (GRANT NO.

FIRST, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION PROCESSES DO NOT FOLLOW A SET SEQUENCE BUT RATHER EMERGE FROM COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS INVOLVING MANY ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS OPERATING SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM LOCAL TO GLOBAL SCALES. BARRIERS ARISE AT ALL STAGES OF INNOVATION, FROM THE INVENTION OF A TECHNOLOGY THROUGH ITS SELECTION, PRODUCTION, ADAPTATION, ADOPTION, AND RETIREMENT. SECOND, LEARNING FROM PAST EFFORTS TO MOBILIZE INNOVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE GREATLY IMPROVED THROUGH STRUCTURED CROSS-SECTORAL COMPARISONS THAT RECOGNIZE THE SOCIO-TECHNICAL NATURE OF INNOVATION SYSTEMS. THIRD, CURRENT INSTITUTIONS (RULES, NORMS, AND INCENTIVES) SHAPING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION ARE OFTEN NOT ALIGNED TOWARD THE GOALS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IMPOVERISHED, MARGINALIZED, AND UNBORN POPULATIONS TOO OFTEN LACK THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER TO SHAPE INNOVATION SYSTEMS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. HOWEVER, THESE INSTITUTIONS CAN BE REFORMED, AND MANY ACTORS HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO THROUGH RESEARCH, ADVOCACY, TRAINING, CONVENING, POLICYMAKING, AND FINANCING. WE CONCLUDE WITH THREE PRACTICEORIENTED RECOMMENDATIONS TO FURTHER REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF INNOVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: (I) CHANNELS FOR REGULARIZED LEARNING ACROSS DOMAINS OF PRACTICE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED, (II) MEASURES THAT SYSTEMATICALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE INNOVATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED, AND (III) INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE REFORMED TO REORIENT INNOVATION SYSTEMS TOWARD SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ENSURE THAT ALL INNOVATION STAGES AND SCALES ARE CONSIDERED AT THE OUTSET.",SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS; COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; SECTORAL SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; RECONFIGURATION; IRRIGATION; STRATEGIES; RESISTANCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,28,"MOON, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), HARVARD UNIV, HARVARD KENNEDY SCH GOVT, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.;MOON, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), HARVARD UNIV, HARVARD TH CHAN SCH PUBL HLTH, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA.;MOON, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), GRAD INST INT \& DEV STUDIES, GLOBAL HLTH CTR, CH-1202 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.;ANADONA, LAURA DIAZ, HARLEY, ALICIA G., MOON, SUERIE, CLARK, WILLIAM C., HARVARD UNIV, HARVARD KENNEDY SCH GOVT, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.;ANADONA, LAURA DIAZ, MATUS, KIRA, UCL, DEPT SCI TECHNOL ENGN \& PUBL POLICY, LONDON W1T 6EY, ENGLAND.;CHAN, GABRIEL, UNIV MINNESOTA, HUMPHREY SCH PUBL AFFAIRS, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA.;MOON, SUERIE, HARVARD UNIV, HARVARD TH CHAN SCH PUBL HLTH, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA.;MURTHY, SHARMILA L., SUFFOLK UNIV, SCH LAW, BOSTON, MA 02108 USA.;ANADONA, LAURA DIAZ, UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT POLIT \& INT STUDIES, CAMBRIDGE CB3 9DT, ENGLAND.;MOON, SUERIE, GRAD INST INT \& DEV STUDIES, GLOBAL HLTH CTR, CH-1202 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.",10.1073/PNAS.1525004113,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",NA,NA,"WEATHERHEAD CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY; SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE PROGRAM AT HARVARD AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON; DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND PUBLIC POLICY AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON; SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE PROGRAM AT HKS; ITALY'S MINISTRY FOR ENVIRONMENT, LAND, AND SEA; SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAM OF THE HKS BELFER CENTER FOR SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","WE THANK THE MANY RESEARCHERS WHO CONTRIBUTED CASE STUDIES AND BACKGROUND PAPERS TO THE PROJECT AND PROVIDED HELPFUL FEEDBACK: AHMED ABDEL LATIF, DWAYNE APPLEBY, KATHLEEN ARAUJO, FRANCOISE BICHAI, KAYJE BOOKER, HYUNDO CHOI, SHARON DAVIS, BRIAN DILLON, KRISTIAN DUBRAWSKI, STEPHEN ELLIOTT, RAM FISHMAN, LONIA FRIEDLANDER, ARANI KAJENTHIRA GRINDLE, BEN HURLBUT, CHRISTINA INGERSOLL, ERIN KEMPSTER, DANIELE LANTAGNE, LAURA PEREIRA, POLINA PONCE DE LEON, JOHN-ARNE ROTTINGEN, DANIEL SHEMIE, LUCILLA SPINI, JENNIE STEPHENS, VANESSA TIMMER, LIVIO VALENTI, LEE VINSEL, MARK WILLIAMS, PAUL WILSON, AND ALYSSA YAMAMOTO.

WE REVIEWED 386 JOURNAL ARTICLES ON TRANSITION MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS LISTED IN SCOPUS FROM 1995 TO 2014. WE INVESTIGATE THE THESIS THAT ACTORS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED IN THIS LITERATURE IN FAVOR OF MORE ABSTRACT SYSTEM CONCEPTS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS THESIS CANNOT BE CONFIRMED ON A GENERAL LEVEL. RATHER, WE FIND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES, DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEMIC LEVEL, FOR CLUSTERING ACTORS AND AGENCY AS NICHE, REGIME, AND LANDSCAPE ACTORS, THE SOCIETAL REALM, DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE, AND INTERMEDIARIES. WE ALSO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING ACTORS.

SCI. U. S. A.,"THIS PAPER DISTILLS CORE LESSONS ABOUT HOW RESEARCHERS (SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, PLANNERS, ETC.) INTERESTED IN PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CAN INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF PRODUCING USABLE KNOWLEDGE. WE DRAW THE LESSONS FROM BOTH PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN DIVERSE CONTEXTS AROUND THE WORLD AND FROM SCHOLARLY ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND SOCIETY. MANY OF THESE LESSONS WILL BE FAMILIAR TO THOSE WITH EXPERIENCE IN CRAFTING KNOWLEDGE TO SUPPORT ACTION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, FEW ARE INCLUDED IN THE FORMAL TRAINING OF RESEARCHERS. AS A RESULT, WHEN SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS FIRST VENTURE OUT OF THE LABORATORY OR LIBRARY WITH THE GOAL OF LINKING THEIR KNOWLEDGE WITH ACTION, THE OUTCOME HAS OFTEN BEEN INEFFECTIVENESS AND DISILLUSIONMENT. WE THEREFORE ARTICULATE HERE A CORE SET OF LESSONS THAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD BECOME PART OF THE BASIC TRAINING FOR RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN CRAFTING USABLE KNOWLEDGE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THESE LESSONS ENTAIL AT LEAST FOUR THINGS RESEARCHERS SHOULD KNOW, AND FOUR THINGS THEY SHOULD DO. THE KNOWING LESSONS INVOLVE UNDERSTANDING THE COPRODUCTION RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH WHICH KNOWLEDGE MAKING AND DECISION MAKING SHAPE ONE ANOTHER IN SOCIAL-ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS. WE HIGHLIGHT THE LESSONS THAT EMERGE FROM EXAMINING THOSE COPRODUCTION RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH THE ICAP LENS, VIEWING THEM FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF INNOVATION SYSTEMS, COMPLEX SYSTEMS, ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS, AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS. THE DOING LESSONS INVOLVE IMPROVING THE CAPACITY OF THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO PUT ITS UNDERSTANDING OF COPRODUCTION INTO PRACTICE.

NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.,"PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE DETERMINANTS OF EFFECTIVENESS IN KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS SEEKING TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF ``BOUNDARY WORK THROUGH WHICH RESEARCH COMMUNITIES ORGANIZE THEIR RELATIONS WITH NEW SCIENCE, OTHER SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THE WORLDS OF ACTION AND POLICY-MAKING. A GROWING BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP POSTULATES SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF BOUNDARY WORK THAT PROMOTE USED AND USEFUL RESEARCH. THESE PROPOSITIONS, HOWEVER, ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF A FEW INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. WE REPORT HERE ON AN EFFORT TO EVALUATE THEIR RELEVANCE FOR EFFORTS TO HARNESS SCIENCE IN SUPPORT OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. WE CARRIED OUT A MULTICOUNTRY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH. WE DISCOVERED SIX DISTINCTIVE KINDS OF BOUNDARY WORK CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE PROGRAMS-A GREATER VARIETY THAN HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES. WE ARGUE THAT THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOUNDARY WORK CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A DUAL RESPONSE TO THE DIFFERENT USES FOR WHICH THE RESULTS OF SPECIFIC RESEARCH PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED, AND THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE DRAWN ON BY THOSE PROGRAMS. WE SHOW THAT THESE DISTINCTIVE KINDS OF BOUNDARY WORK REQUIRE DISTINCTIVE STRATEGIES TO ORGANIZE THEM EFFECTIVELY. ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ARE ARRANGEMENTS REGARDING PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS, ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNANCE, AND THE USE OF ``BOUNDARY OBJECTS.

ROMAN P;THIRY G,THE INCLUSIVE WEALTH INDEX. A CRITICAL APPRAISAL,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,ECOL. ECON.,"AMONG RECENT HIGH-PROFILE PROPOSITIONS TO REVISE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS AND TO PROVIDE NEW INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND WELL-BEING, THE INCLUSIVE WEALTH FRAMEWORK AND THE RELATED INCLUSIVE WEALTH INDEX (IWI) UNDOUBTEDLY STAND OUT AS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING ENDEAVOURS. BUILT UP AT THE CONFLUENCE OF WELFARE, DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY ECONOMICS, THE INDICATOR HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO BRING INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEALTH OF NATIONS AND THEIR SUSTAIN ABILITY, IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. THE INCLUSIVE WEALTH FRAMEWORK IS NEVERTHELESS FRAUGHT WITH LIMITATIONS, DUE TO QUESTIONABLE THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS, GAPS IN DATA AVAILABILITY, UNREALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE AND INABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR DISTRIBUTIONAL ISSUES. WE PROPOSE A NON-EXHAUSTIVE CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE INDEX AND ITS UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK. WE CONCLUDE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS UNDERMINE ITS CAPACITY TO FULFIL THE REQUIREMENTS OF A SATISFACTORY SUSTAINABILITY INDICATOR. WE ARGUE THAT MOST PROBLEMS LIE IN THE SUBSTANTIAL DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE INCLUSIVE AMBITION OF THE INDICATOR AND THE SCARCE MEANS TO IMPLEMENT IT. WHEREAS THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE VARIOUS ASSETS THAT CONSTITUTE WEALTH AS WELL AS THEIR COMPLEX EVOLUTION THROUGH TIME ARE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PROPONENTS OF INCLUSIVE WEALTH, THE WAY THE IWI IS COMPUTED IS RATHER A MERE ADDITION OF LAYERS OF ACTUARIAL-LIKE MONETARY VALUES FOR A (NOT INCLUSIVE YET) RANGE OF CAPITAL ASSETS.

A.,"GLOBAL MARKETS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, TIMBER, AND MINERALS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF DEFORESTATION. THE SUPPLY CHAINS DRIVING LAND USE CHANGE MAY ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO HALT DEFORESTATION. MARKET CAMPAIGNS, MORATORIA, AND CERTIFICATION SCHEMES HAVE BEEN PROMOTED AS POWERFUL TOOLS TO ACHIEVE CONSERVATION GOALS. DESPITE THEIR PROMISE, THERE HAVE BEEN FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO RIGOROUSLY QUANTIFY THE ABILITY OF THESE NONSTATE, MARKET-DRIVEN (NSMD) GOVERNANCE REGIMES TO DELIVER CONSERVATION OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE IMPACTS OF THREE NSMD GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS THAT SOUGHT TO END THE CONVERSION OF NATURAL FORESTS TO PLANTATIONS IN CHILE AT THE START OF THE 21ST CENTURY. USING A MULTILEVEL, PANEL DATASET OF LAND USE CHANGES IN CHILE, WE IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF PARTICIPATION WITHIN EACH OF THE GOVERNANCE REGIMES BY IMPLEMENTING A SERIES OF MATCHED DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES ANALYSES. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MOSAIC OF DIFFERENT NSMD REGIMES ADOPTED IN CHILE, WE EXPLORE THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT POLICIES. NSMD GOVERNANCE REGIMES REDUCED DEFORESTATION ON PARTICIPATING PROPERTIES BY 2-23\%. THE NSMD GOVERNANCE REGIMES WE STUDIED INCLUDED COLLABORATIVE AND CONFRONTATIONAL STRATEGIES BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. WE FIND THAT THE MORE COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS STUDIED ACHIEVED BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE THAN MORE CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACHES. WHEREAS MANY GOVERNMENT CONSERVATION PROGRAMS HAVE TARGETED REGIONS WITH LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF CONVERSION, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT NSMD GOVERNANCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER BEHAVIOR ON HIGH-DEFORESTATION PROPERTIES.",DEFORESTATION; TIMBER; CERTIFICATION; PROGRAM EVALUATION; SUPPLY CHAINS,ECONOMETRIC EVALUATION ESTIMATOR; COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE; POLICY INSTRUMENTS; DEFORESTATION; CERTIFICATION; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; STRATEGIES; INFERENCE; PROGRAMS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,41,"HEILMAYR, R, LAMBIN, EF (REPRINT AUTHOR), STANFORD UNIV, EMMETT INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM ENVIRONM \& RESOU, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA.;LAMBIN, EF (REPRINT AUTHOR), CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN, GEORGES LEMAITRE CTR EARTH \& CLIMATE RES, EARTH \& LIFE INST, B-1348 LOUVAIN, BELGIUM.;LAMBIN, EF (REPRINT AUTHOR), STANFORD UNIV, SCH EARTH ENERGY \& ENVIRONM SCI, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA.;LAMBIN, EF (REPRINT AUTHOR), STANFORD UNIV, WOODS INST ENVIRONM, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA.;HEILMAYR, ROBERT, LAMBIN, ERIC F., STANFORD UNIV, EMMETT INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM ENVIRONM \& RESOU, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA.;LAMBIN, ERIC F., CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN, GEORGES LEMAITRE CTR EARTH \& CLIMATE RES, EARTH \& LIFE INST, B-1348 LOUVAIN, BELGIUM.;LAMBIN, ERIC F., STANFORD UNIV, SCH EARTH ENERGY \& ENVIRONM SCI, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA.;LAMBIN, ERIC F., STANFORD UNIV, WOODS INST ENVIRONM, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA.",10.1073/PNAS.1600394113,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",NA,NA,ROBERT AND PATRICIA SWITZER ENVIRONMENTAL FOUNDATION; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DGE-1147470],"WE THANK FRAN MOORE, LAUREN OAKES, SUZI KERR, AND LAWRENCE GOULDER FOR THEIR COMMENTS, AND JULIE SCRIVNER, ELIF TASAR, AND KARLA KING FOR THEIR RESEARCH SUPPORT.

CARBON LOCK-IN IS A SPECIAL CASE OF PATH DEPENDENCY, WHICH IS COMMON IN THE EVOLUTION OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, CARBON LOCK-IN IS PARTICULARLY PRONE TO ENTRENCHMENT GIVEN THE LARGE CAPITAL COSTS, LONG INFRASTRUCTURE LIFETIMES, AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL SYSTEMS INVOLVED.

SIEBENHUENER B;RODELA R;ECKER F,SOCIAL LEARNING RESEARCH IN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS: A SURVEY,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY,ENVIRON. SCI. POLICY,"SOCIAL LEARNING STUDIES EMERGED AS PART OF THE ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS RESEARCH AGENDA RATHER RECENTLY. QUESTIONS OF HOW HUMAN SOCIETIES AND ORGANISATIONS LEARN AND TRANSITION ON THE BASIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE RELATE TO THE CORE IDEAS OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS WITH ITS PLURALISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR IN CONTRAST TO THE LIMITED FOCUS ON INCENTIVE-DRIVEN BEHAVIOUR. OUR STUDY ANALYSES THE EMERGENCE AND THEMATIC FOCI OF SOCIAL LEARNING STUDIES WITHIN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS. WE SELECTED AND ANALYSED 54 ARTICLES PUBLISHED AFTER PEER REVIEW IN ESTABLISHED JOURNALS ADHERING TO THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL TRADITION OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS. THIS STUDY IS GUIDED BY THE INTEREST IN HOW SOCIAL LEARNING IS CONCEPTUALISED, HOW THIS RESEARCH IS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF PROCESS DYNAMICS, CAUSAL FACTORS AND OUTCOMES OF LEARNING. RESULTS SHOW, THAT THE NUMBER OF RELATED PAPERS GREW SUBSTANTIALLY IN RECENT YEARS. ALSO THE ROLE OF FORMAL OR INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A STRONG CAUSAL FACTOR FOR SOCIAL LEARNING AND CHANGE PROCESSES VIS-A-VIS TECHNOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A GROWING AWARENESS OF SOCIAL LEARNING PROCESSES IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY FIELDS SUCH AS BIODIVERSITY GOVERNANCE, WATER AND LAND MANAGEMENT, FISHERIES, AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT THESE INSIGHTS CAN GIVE NEW IMPULSES TO RESEARCH ON SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION AND TO THE RELATED DEBATE ON SOCIETAL CHANGE AND TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES AS CORE TOPICS FOR ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS.

ERIKSEN SH;NIGHTINGALE AJ;EAKIN H,REFRAMING ADAPTATION: THE POLITICAL NATURE OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,GLOB. ENVIRON. CHANGE-HUMAN POLICY DIMENS.,"THIS PAPER IS MOTIVATED BY A CONCERN THAT ADAPTATION AND VULNERABILITY RESEARCH SUFFER FROM AN UNDER-THEORIZATION OF THE POLITICAL MECHANISMS OF SOCIAL CHANGE AND THE PROCESSES THAT SERVE TO REPRODUCE VULNERABILITY OVER TIME AND SPACE. WE ARGUE THAT ADAPTATION IS A SOCIO-POLITICAL PROCESS THAT MEDIATES HOW INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVES DEAL WITH MULTIPLE AND CONCURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES. WE PROPOSE THAT APPLYING CONCEPTS OF SUBJECTIVITY, KNOWLEDGES AND AUTHORITY TO THE ANALYSIS OF ADAPTATION FOCUSES ATTENTION ON THIS SOCIO-POLITICAL PROCESS. DRAWING FROM VULNERABILITY, ADAPTATION, POLITICAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIAL THEORY LITERATURES, WE EXPLAIN HOW POWER IS REPRODUCED OR CONTESTED IN ADAPTATION PRACTICE THROUGH THESE THREE CONCEPTS. WE ASSERT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PROCESSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CONSTITUTE AS WELL AS CONTEST AUTHORITY, SUBJECTIVITY AND KNOWLEDGE, THEREBY OPENING UP OR CLOSING DOWN SPACE FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL ADAPTATION. WE EXPAND ON THIS ASSERTION THROUGH FOUR KEY PROPOSITIONS ABOUT HOW ADAPTATION PROCESSES CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AND OUTLINE AN EMERGENT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH AGENDA, WHICH AIMS TO EXPLICITLY EXAMINE THESE PROPOSITIONS IN SPECIFIC SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXTS. WE DESCRIBE HOW THE ARTICLES IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS NASCENT RESEARCH AGENDA, PROVIDING AN EMPIRICAL BASIS FROM WHICH TO THEORIZE THE POLITICS OF ADAPTATION. THE FINAL SECTION CONCLUDES BY DESCRIBING THE NEED FOR A REFRAMING OF ADAPTATION POLICY, PRACTICE AND ANALYSIS TO ENGAGE WITH MULTIPLE ADAPTATION KNOWLEDGES, TO QUESTION SUBJECTIVITIES INHERENT IN DISCOURSES AND PROBLEM UNDERSTANDINGS, AND TO IDENTIFY HOW EMANCIPATORY SUBJECTIVITIES - AND THUS THE POTENTIAL FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL ADAPTATION - CAN BE SUPPORTED.

ENVIRON. CHANGE-HUMAN POLICY DIMENS.,"THIS CONCEPTUAL REVIEW ARTICLE PROVIDES A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION RESEARCH, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FRAMED BY TWO GENERIC POSITIONS. FIRST, THE `REFORMIST' POSITION, WHICH FOCUSES ON FIRMS PURSUING GREEN ECO-INNOVATIONS AND CONSUMERS BUYING ECO-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS, REPRESENTS THE POLITICAL AND ACADEMIC ORTHODOXY. SECOND, THE `REVOLUTIONARY' POSITION, WHICH IS A RADICAL CRITIQUE OF THE MAINSTREAM, ADVOCATES THE ABOLISHMENT OF CAPITALISM, MATERIALISM, AND CONSUMERISM, AND PROMOTES VALUES SUCH AS FRUGALITY, SUFFICIENCY, AND LOCALISM. WE FIND THIS DICHOTOMOUS DEBATE PROBLEMATIC, BECAUSE IT IS INTELLECTUALLY STIFLING AND POLITICALLY CONSERVATIVE (IN ITS OUTCOMES). TO MOVE BEYOND THIS DICHOTOMY, WE PROPOSE A THIRD POSITION, `RECONFIGURATION', WHICH FOCUSES ON TRANSITIONS IN SOCIO-TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND DAILY LIFE PRACTICES AND ACCOMMODATES NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS. FOR EACH OF THE THREE POSITIONS, WE DISCUSS: (1) THE SCALE AND TYPE OF CHANGE, (2) VIEWS ON CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION IN EXEMPLARY APPROACHES, (3) UNDERLYING THEORETICAL, EPISTEMOLOGICAL AND NORMATIVE ORIENTATIONS, (4) POLICY IMPLICATIONS, AND (5) CRITICAL APPRAISAL. THE CONCLUSION COMPARES THE THREE POSITIONS, PROVIDES ARGUMENTS FOR THE FRUITFULNESS OF THE RECONFIGURATION-POSITION AND OFFERS FOUR CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION RESEARCH AGENDAS.

POLICY,"CAN NORMS OF DISTRIBUTIVE FAIRNESS SERVE AS PILLARS OF A NEW AND MORE EFFECTIVE GLOBAL CLIMATE REGIME? THREE GENERAL PRINCIPLES - RESPONSIBILITIES, CAPABILITIES (CAPACITY), AND NEEDS (OR RIGHTS) - ARE FREQUENTLY INVOKED AND RARELY DISPUTED. YET, PARTIES' INTERPRETATIONS OFTEN DIVERGE, REFLECTING CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS. TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE, WE COMPARE -BY MEANS OF A GLOBAL INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODEL (GRACE) - 15 LEGITIMATE INTERPRETATIONS OF `RESPONSIBILITIES' AND `CAPABILITIES' IN TERMS OF THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS AND COSTS OF SEVEN POTENTIALLY PIVOTAL ACTORS. MOST OF THESE INTERPRETATIONS YIELD SIMILAR RESULTS FOR MOST ACTORS. IN A SCENARIO WHERE GLOBAL EMISSIONS IN 2030 ARE REDUCED BY 20\% COMPARED TO A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL BASELINE, MITIGATION COSTS VARY BY LESS THAN 1\% OF GDP FOR THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, JAPAN, INDIA, AND CHINA. FOR BRAZIL AND RUSSIA, HOWEVER, VARIANCE IS MUCH LARGER. MOREOVER, FOR ALL ACTORS, MITIGATION COSTS RISE STEEPLY AS AMBITION LEVELS INCREASE. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, SEARCHING FOR A SINGLE `FAIRNESS-OPTIMIZING' FORMULA IS LIKELY TO FAIL. AS NEGOTIATORS EXPLORE SYSTEMS OF VOLUNTARY PLEDGES, A MORE PROMISING APPROACH WOULD CONCEIVE OF FAIRNESS AS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCT AND FOSTER ACCOMMODATION THROUGH MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF A LIMITED RANGE OF LEGITIMATE NORM INTERPRETATIONS.

HOWEVER, DESPITE THE PROLIFERATION OF FOREST CERTIFICATION OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, FEW STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED ITS EFFECTIVENESS. USING TEMPORALLY AND SPATIALLY EXPLICIT VILLAGE-LEVEL DATA ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS IN KALIMANTAN (INDONESIA), WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FSC-CERTIFIED TIMBER CONCESSIONS COMPARED TO NON-CERTIFIED LOGGING CONCESSIONS. EMPLOYING TRIPLE DIFFERENCE MATCHING ESTIMATORS, WE FIND THAT BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 FSC REDUCED AGGREGATE DEFORESTATION BY 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS AND THE INCIDENCE OF AIR POLLUTION BY 31\%. IT HAD NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON FIRE INCIDENCE OR CORE AREAS, BUT INCREASED FOREST PERFORATION BY 4 KM(2) ON AVERAGE. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT FSC REDUCED FIREWOOD DEPENDENCE (BY 33\%), RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS (BY 32\%) AND MALNUTRITION (BY 1 PERSON) ON AVERAGE.

LE BLANC D,TOWARDS INTEGRATION AT LAST? THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AS A NETWORK OF TARGETS,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,SUSTAIN. DEV.,"IN 2014, UNITED NATIONS MEMBER STATES PROPOSED A SET OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS), WHICH WILL SUCCEED THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS) AS REFERENCE GOALS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY FOR THE PERIOD 2015-2030. THE PROPOSED GOALS AND TARGETS CAN BE SEEN AS A NETWORK, IN WHICH LINKS AMONG GOALS EXIST THROUGH TARGETS THAT REFER TO MULTIPLE GOALS. USING NETWORK ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES, WE SHOW THAT SOME THEMATIC AREAS COVERED BY THE SDGS ARE WELL CONNECTED WITH ONE ANOTHER. OTHER PARTS OF THE NETWORK HAVE WEAKER CONNECTIONS WITH THE REST OF THE SYSTEM. THE SDGS AS A WHOLE ARE A MORE INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAN THE MDGS WERE, WHICH MAY FACILITATE POLICY INTEGRATION ACROSS SECTORS. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE LINKS AMONG GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN BIOPHYSICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS ARE NOT EXPLICITLY REFLECTED IN THE SDGS. BEYOND THE ADDED VISIBILITY THAT THE SDGS PROVIDE TO LINKS AMONG THEMATIC AREAS, ATTEMPTS AT POLICY INTEGRATION ACROSS VARIOUS AREAS WILL HAVE TO BE BASED ON STUDIES OF THE BIOPHYSICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS AT APPROPRIATE SCALES.

CHANGE,"IN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODELLING OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION, THERE ARE TWO MAIN USES FOR MEASURES OF CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE FIRST IS TO REPRESENT THE CAPACITY FOR PROACTIVE ADAPTATION: THIS CAN BE TERMED ADAPTIVE CAPACITY. THE SECOND IS TO REPRESENT THE CAPACITY FOR REACTIVE OR INSTANTANEOUS COPING: THIS CAN BE TERMED COPING CAPACITY. ADAPTIVE CAPACITY HELPS TO DETERMINE WHICH PROACTIVE ADAPTATION OPTIONS ARE FEASIBLE AS INPUTS TO THE MODELS UNDER ANY GIVEN PAIR OF CLIMATE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC SCENARIOS. COPING CAPACITY REPRESENTS THE RESIDUAL ABILITY TO REACT TO CONDITIONS, AND INFLUENCES VULNERABILITY UNDER ANY GIVEN SET OF MODEL OUTPUTS. USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE CLIMSAVE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT PLATFORM, WE EXPLAIN HOW THESE CAPACITIES CAN BE REPRESENTED IN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT. WE DEMONSTRATE HOW AN INDEX OF ADAPTIVE AND COPING CAPACITY CAN BE DEVELOPED USING A FIVE-CAPITALS (HUMAN, SOCIAL, MANUFACTURED, NATURAL, FINANCIAL) MODEL OF SOCIETAL WEALTH AND INCORPORATED IN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODELS. WE FIND THAT FOR VERY AGGREGATE APPLICATIONS, BUT NOT LOCAL OR SECTORAL APPLICATIONS, THE SAME INDICATORS CAN BE USED TO SIMULATE ADAPTIVE AND COPING CAPACITY.

SOC.,"TACKLING MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE ISSUES REQUIRES EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND GOVERNANCE, BUT RELATIVELY LITTLE WORK IN THIS AREA HAS EXAMINED THE DIVERSITY OF SETTINGS FROM WHICH SUCH PARTNERSHIPS MAY, OR MAY NOT, EMERGE. IN THIS SPECIAL FEATURE WE DRAW ON EXPERIENCES FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO DEMONSTRATE AND INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF DIVERSE CAPACITIES AND CAPABILITIES IN BRINGING SCIENCE AND GOVERNANCE TOGETHER. WE PROPOSE THE CONCEPT OF COPRODUCTIVE CAPACITIES AS A USEFUL NEW LENS THROUGH WHICH TO EXAMINE THESE RELATIONS. COPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY IS ``THE COMBINATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESOURCES AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITY THAT SHAPES THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SOCIETY, AT VARIOUS LEVELS, CAN OPERATIONALIZE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC AND PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS TO EFFECT SCIENTIFICALLY-INFORMED SOCIAL CHANGE. THIS RECASTS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND SOCIETY FROM NOTIONS OF ``GAPS TO NOTIONS OF INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND INTERPLAY (COPRODUCTION), ALONGSIDE THE SOCIETAL FOUNDATIONS THAT SHAPE WHAT IS OR IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THAT DYNAMIC CONNECTION (CAPACITIES). THE ARTICLES IN THIS SPECIAL FEATURE APPLY THIS CONCEPT TO REVEAL SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS THAT BOTH SUPPORT AND INHIBIT HIGH-QUALITY ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AS GLOBAL ISSUES ARE TACKLED IN PARTICULAR PLACES. ACROSS THESE ARTICLES WE SUGGEST THAT FIVE THEMES EMERGE AS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING COPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY: HISTORY, EXPERIENCE, AND PERCEPTIONS, QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPS (ESPECIALLY IN SUBOPTIMAL SETTINGS), DISJUNCT ACROSS SCALES, POWER, INTERESTS, AND LEGITIMACY, AND ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE.

YET EFFORTS TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE, AS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE OVER THE LAST DECADE AND IN SELECTED CASE STUDIES, HAVE NOT LED TO SUBSTANTIAL RATES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF ADAPTATION ACTIONS DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN ADAPTATION SCIENCE. MOREOVER, IMPLEMENTED ACTIONS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY INCREMENTAL AND FOCUSED ON PROXIMATE CAUSES, THERE ARE FAR FEWER REPORTS OF MORE SYSTEMIC OR TRANSFORMATIVE ACTIONS. WE FOUND THAT THE NATURE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RESPONSES WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY FRAMING. RECENT DECISION-ORIENTED APPROACHES THAT AIM TO OVERCOME THIS SITUATION ARE FRAMED WITHIN A ``PATHWAYS METAPHOR TO EMPHASISE THE NEED FOR ROBUST DECISION MAKING WITHIN ADAPTIVE PROCESSES IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY AND INTER-TEMPORAL COMPLEXITY. HOWEVER, TO DATE, SUCH ``ADAPTATION PATHWAYS APPROACHES HAVE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON CONTEXTS WITH CLEARLY IDENTIFIED DECISION-MAKERS AND UNAMBIGUOUS GOALS, AS A RESULT, THEY GENERALLY ASSUME PREVAILING GOVERNANCE REGIMES ARE CONDUCIVE FOR ADAPTATION AND HENCE CONSTRAIN RESPONSES TO PROXIMATE CAUSES OF VULNERABILITY. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLORE A BROADER CONCEPTUALISATION OF ``ADAPTATION PATHWAYS THAT DRAWS ON `PATHWAYS THINKING' IN THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DOMAIN TO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF PATH DEPENDENCY, INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ADAPTATION PLANS, VESTED INTERESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE, AND SITUATIONS WHERE VALUES, INTERESTS, OR INSTITUTIONS CONSTRAIN SOCIETAL RESPONSES TO CHANGE. THIS RECONCEPTUALISATION OF ADAPTATION PATHWAYS AIMS TO INFORM DECISION MAKERS ABOUT INTEGRATING INCREMENTAL ACTIONS ON PROXIMATE CAUSES WITH THE TRANSFORMATIVE ASPECTS OF SOCIETAL CHANGE. CASE STUDIES ILLUSTRATE WHAT THIS MIGHT ENTAIL. THE PAPER ENDS WITH A CALL FOR FURTHER EXPLORATION OF THEORY, METHODS AND PROCEDURES TO OPERATIONALISE THIS BROADER CONCEPTUALISATION OF ADAPTATION.

ENVIRON. CHANGE-HUMAN POLICY DIMENS.,"SINCE THE WORLD WAR II, MANY ECONOMIES HAVE TRANSITIONED FROM AN AGRARIAN, BIOMASS-BASED TO AN INDUSTRIAL, MINERALS-BASED METABOLIC REGIME. SINCE 1950, WORLD POPULATION GREW BY FACTOR 2.7 AND GLOBAL MATERIAL CONSUMPTION BY FACTOR 3.7-71 GIGATONNES PER YEAR IN 2010. THE EXPANSION OF THE RESOURCE BASE REQUIRED BY HUMAN SOCIETIES IS ASSOCIATED WITH GROWING PRESSURE ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND INFRINGEMENT ON THE HABITATS OF OTHER SPECIES. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITION, WE REQUIRE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENTLY ONGOING METABOLIC TRANSITION AND ITS POTENTIAL INERTIA. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT A LONG-TERM GLOBAL MATERIAL FLOW DATASET COVERING MATERIAL EXTRACTION, TRADE, AND CONSUMPTION OF 177 INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1950 AND 2010. WE TRACE PATTERNS AND TRENDS IN MATERIAL FLOWS FOR SIX MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC COUNTRY GROUPINGS AND WORLD REGIONS (WESTERN INDUSTRIAL, THE (FORMER) SOVIET UNION AND ITS ALLIES, ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTHERN AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA) AS WELL AS THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE EMERGENCE OF A GLOBAL METABOLIC PROFILE DURING A PERIOD OF RAPID INDUSTRIALIZATION AND GLOBALIZATION. GLOBAL AVERAGE MATERIAL USE INCREASED FROM 5.0 TO 10.3 TONS PER CAPITA AND YEAR (T/CAP/A) BETWEEN 1950 AND 2010. REGIONAL METABOLIC RATES RANGE FROM 4.5 T/CAP/A IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA TO 14.8 T/CAP/A IN THE WESTERN INDUSTRIAL GROUPING. WHILE WE CAN OBSERVE A STABILIZATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL METABOLIC PROFILE COMPOSED OF RELATIVELY EQUAL SHARES OF BIOMASS, FOSSIL ENERGY CARRIERS, AND CONSTRUCTION MINERALS, WE NOTE DIFFERENCES IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH OTHER REGIONS ARE GRAVITATING TOWARD A SIMILAR FORM OF MATERIAL USE. SINCE 2000, ASIA HAS OVERTAKEN THE WESTERN INDUSTRIAL GROUPING IN TERMS OF ITS SHARE IN GLOBAL RESOURCE USE ALTHOUGH NOT IN TERMS OF ITS PER CAPITA MATERIAL CONSUMPTION. WE FIND THAT AT A SUB-GLOBAL LEVEL, THE ROLES OF THE WORLD REGIONS HAVE CHANGED. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, NO SIGNS YET THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO STABILIZATION OR EVEN A REDUCTION OF GLOBAL RESOURCE USE.

SHE ARGUED, TO THE CONTRARY, THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF STATE ACTION ARE OFTEN NECESSARY TO SOLVE COMPLEX COMMON-POOL RESOURCE PROBLEMS. IN OSTROM'S CENTRAL CONCEPT OF POLYCENTRISM, LOCAL DECISION MAKING GROUPS MUST OFTEN BE ``NESTED WITHIN STATE STRUCTURES AT A HIGHER LEVEL, SO THAT THE HIGHER STRUCTURES CAN PROVIDE THE COERCION AND OTHER RESOURCES THAT MAKE LOCAL NEGOTIATION EFFICIENT. THE STATE HAS FOUR POTENTIALLY CRUCIAL ROLES IN A POLYCENTRIC SYSTEM. THE FIRST IS TO THREATEN TO IMPOSE A SOLUTION (A ``PUBLIC-INTEREST PENALTY DEFAULT) IF LOCAL PARTIES CANNOT COME TO A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT. THE SECOND IS TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF RELATIVELY NEUTRAL INFORMATION TO MITIGATE THE PROBLEM OF SELF-SERVING BIAS REGARDING THE RELEVANT FACTS. THE THIRD IS TO PROVIDE AN ARENA FOR NEGOTIATING THAT FACILITATES LOW-COST, ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENTS. THE FOURTH IS TO HELP MONITOR COMPLIANCE AND SANCTION DEFECTION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. ALL FOUR ARISE IN GOVERNING THE COMMONS. TODAY WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, WHICH HAS NO STATE.

CHANG.,"THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THERE IS A POWERFUL TENDENCY IN FORECASTING OF SOCIO-TECHNICAL CHANGE TO FOCUS ON THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGE AT THE COST OF GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONS FOR AND SIGNIFICANCE OF CONTINUITY. TAKING THE CASE OF THE GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, THE PAPER THEREFORE ANALYSES THE EVIDENCE FOR SYSTEMIC CONTINUITY IN TECHNOLOGIES, ECONOMIC STRUCTURES, CULTURAL POSITIONING AND EMBEDDED SOCIAL FUNCTION THROUGH THE LENS OF TRANSITION THEORY AND THE MULTI-LEVEL PERSPECTIVE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBSERVABLE PROCESSES ARE AS MUCH ABOUT ENDURING TECHNOLOGIES AND SOCIAL PRACTICES AS THEY ARE ABOUT SYSTEMIC CHANGE. THAT IS, THE INDUSTRY HAS SHOWN RESISTANCE TO CHANGE NOTWITHSTANDING THE APPARENT IMPERATIVES FOR RADICAL ACTION OR THE MULTITUDE OF ATTEMPTS VIA SOCIO-TECHNICAL EXPERIMENTATION TO NURTURE STRATEGIC NICHES. AT A THEORETICAL LEVEL, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT GREATER ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO UNDERSTANDING HOW CHANGE CAN BE NULLIFIED. MOREOVER, THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS OF SYSTEMIC CHANGE NEED A GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE WAY IN WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSITION AS A PROCESS MAY MEAN THAT MANY EXISTING PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES ARE RETAINED MORE OR LESS INTACT RATHER THAN ENTIRELY REPLACED BY NEW PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES. THE FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA NEEDS THEREFORE TO UNDERSTAND MORE FULLY HOW EMBEDDED PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE INTER-RELATE IN SPECIFIC CONCRETE CONDITIONS. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER INC.

MARSHALL NA;PARK SE;ADGER WN;BROWN K;HOWDEN SM,TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPACITY AND THE INFLUENCE OF PLACE AND IDENTITY,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,ENVIRON. RES. LETT.,"CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALTERING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES WITH FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR THOSE WHO DEPEND ON THEM. RESOURCE-DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES AND COMMUNITIES NEED THE CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO A RANGE OF CLIMATE RISKS IF THEY ARE TO REMAIN VIABLE. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE SCALE AND NATURE OF THE LIKELY IMPACTS MEANS THAT TRANSFORMATIONS OF FUNCTION OR STRUCTURE WILL BE REQUIRED. TRANSFORMATIONS REPRESENT A SWITCH TO A DISTINCT NEW SYSTEM WHERE A DIFFERENT SUITE OF FACTORS BECOME IMPORTANT IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RESPONSE STRATEGIES. THERE IS A CRITICAL GAP IN KNOWLEDGE ON UNDERSTANDING TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPACITY AND ITS INFLUENCES. ON THE BASIS OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON ADAPTIVE CAPACITY WE PROPOSE FOUR FOUNDATIONS FOR MEASURING TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPACITY: (1) HOW RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY ARE MANAGED, (2) THE EXTENT OF SKILLS IN PLANNING, LEARNING AND REORGANIZING, (3) THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY TO UNDERTAKE CHANGE AND (4) THE WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE CHANGE. WE TEST THE INFLUENCE OF PLACE ATTACHMENT AND OCCUPATIONAL IDENTITY ON TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPACITY USING THE AUSTRALIAN PEANUT INDUSTRY, WHICH IS PRESENTLY ASSESSING SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO PREDICTED CLIMATIC CHANGES. SURVEY DATA FROM 88\% OF PEANUT FARMERS IN QUEENSLAND SHOW A STRONG NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPACITY AND BOTH PLACE ATTACHMENT AND OCCUPATIONAL ATTACHMENT, SUGGESTING THAT WHILST THESE FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT POSITIVE INFLUENCES ON THE CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO INCREMENTAL CHANGE, THEY ACT AS BARRIERS TO TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE.",ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; BARRIERS TO CHANGE; AGRICULTURE; NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL RESILIENCE; SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; RESOURCE DEPENDENCE; CLIMATE CHANGE,INFLUENCE SOCIAL RESILIENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; RESOURCE DEPENDENCY; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; RESPONSES; COMANAGEMENT; AGRICULTURE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,134,"MARSHALL, NA (REPRINT AUTHOR), JAMES COOK UNIV, CSIRO ECOSYST SCI \& CLIMATE ADAPTAT FLAGSHIP, ATSIP BLDG, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA.;MARSHALL, N.

RESOUR,"THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE (PTD) IS A LEGAL CONCEPT WITH ANCIENT ROOTS, AND IT IS INCREASINGLY BEING EXAMINED AS A FRAMEWORK FOR MODERN CONSERVATION. AT ITS CORE, THE PTD IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT CERTAIN NATURAL RESOURCES CANNOT BE FAIRLY OR EFFECTIVELY MANAGED BY PRIVATE OWNERS.

THIS BUILDS ON AND DEVELOPS PREVIOUS COEVOLUTIONARY ANALYSES OF LONG-TERM TECHNOLOGICAL AND INDUSTRIAL CHANGE, AND RECENT RENEWED INTEREST WITHIN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS ON COEVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES. PREVIOUS WORK HAS ANALYSED HOW THE COEVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND INSTITUTIONS HAS LED TO THE LOCK-IN OF CURRENT HIGH-CARBON ENERGY SYSTEMS, AND HOW THE COEVOLUTION OF PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES HAS BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL AND WELFARE BENEFITS TO THE MINORITY OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION LIVING IN INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES. THE COEVOLUTIONARY FRAMEWORK PROPOSED HERE MAY BE USED TO UNDERTAKE: (1) DETAILED EMPIRICAL ANALYSES AT A MICRO-MESO LEVEL OF THE CHALLENGES RELATING TO THE INNOVATION AND ADOPTION OF PARTICULARLY LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES, (2) AS A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSING THE MULTI-LEVEL INTERACTION OF SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL ELEMENTS WITHIN POTENTIAL TRANSITION PATHWAYS TO A LOW CARBON ENERGY SYSTEM, (3) TO ASSESS THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROSPERITY OF A TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY, AND (4) TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE FORMAL, MULTI-LEVEL EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMIC MODELS.

THE ECOLOGICAL QUALITY OF FOREST TRANSITIONS DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL FOREST REGENERATION VERSUS PLANTATIONS. GIVEN AN INCREASED COMPETITION FOR PRODUCTIVE LAND BETWEEN DIFFERENT LAND USES, A GLOBAL FOREST TRANSITION WILL REQUIRE MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND POLICY INNOVATIONS TO SUPPLY WOOD AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. IN THE GLOBALIZATION ERA, NATIONAL STRATEGIES AIMED AT FOREST PROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF FOREST RESOURCES MAY HAVE UNINTENDED EFFECTS ABROAD OWING TO A DISPLACEMENT OF LAND USE ACROSS COUNTRIES.

CHANGE-HUMAN POLICY DIMENS.,"THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CORE QUESTIONS INVOLVED IN ADDRESSING ``GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL COLLECTIVE-ACTION PROBLEM SINCE ALL OF US FACE THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXTREMELY ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT COULD BE REDUCED IF MANY PARTICIPANTS TAKE EXPENSIVE ACTIONS. CONVENTIONAL COLLECTIVE-ACTION THEORY PREDICTS THAT THESE PROBLEMS WILL NOT BE SOLVED UNLESS AN EXTERNAL AUTHORITY DETERMINES APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN, MONITORS BEHAVIOR, AND IMPOSES SANCTIONS. DEBATING ABOUT GLOBAL EFFORTS TO SOLVE CLIMATE-CHANGE PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, HAS YET NOT LED TO AN EFFECTIVE GLOBAL TREATY. FORTUNATELY, MANY ACTIVITIES CAN BE UNDERTAKEN BY MULTIPLE UNITS AT DIVERSE SCALES THAT CUMULATIVELY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I ARGUE THAT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ONLY ON GLOBAL EFFORTS (WHICH ARE INDEED A NECESSARY PART OF THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION), IT IS BETTER TO ENCOURAGE POLYCENTRIC EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES.

CLEMENT F,ANALYSING DECENTRALISED NATURAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE: PROPOSITION FOR A ``POLITICISED INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK,POLICY SCIENCES,POLICY SCI.,"THERE HAS OFTEN BEEN A GAP BETWEEN POLICY INTENTIONS AND OUTCOMES IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE. ANALYSING THE FACTORS FOR THESE DISCREPANCIES REQUIRES MULTI-LEVEL APPROACHES THAT RELATE POLICY DECISIONS FORMULATED AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WITH THE DECISIONS OF LOCAL RESOURCE USERS. A KEY ASSET OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK IS PRECISELY ITS ABILITY TO LINK MULTIPLE GOVERNANCE LEVELS. YET MOST COMMONS LITERATURE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THE STUDY OF COLLECTIVE ACTION AMONG LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITHOUT CONSIDERING HIGHER INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT LEVELS. TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, I POSIT FOR A METHODOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FRAMEWORK, WHICH BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS, POWER-CENTRED AND HISTORICAL APPROACHES, AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS. THE APPLICATION OF THE EXTENDED FRAMEWORK TO THE STUDY OF STATE AFFORESTATION POLICIES IN VIETNAM HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSIDER INSTITUTIONS, THE POLITICO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND DISCOURSES ACROSS GOVERNANCE AND GOVERNMENT LEVELS.

A SECOND PERSPECTIVE ARGUES THAT SOME FIRMS DO LEARN AND ADAPT TO SHIFTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXTS. RECENTLY, THIS LATTER VIEW HAS COALESCED AROUND TWO THEMES.

RESOUR.,"ADAPTATION IS A PROCESS OF DELIBERATE CHANGE IN ANTICIPATION OF OR IN REACTION TO EXTERNAL STIMULI AND STRESS. THE DOMINANT RESEARCH TRADI TION ON ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE PRIMARILY TAKES AN ACTOR-CENTERED VIEW, FOCUSING ON THE AGENCY OF SOCIAL ACTORS TO RESPOND TO SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI AND EMPHASIZING THE REDUCTION OF VULNERABILITIES. THE RESILIENCE APPROACH IS SYSTEMS ORIENTATED, TAKES A MORE DYNAMIC VIEW, AND SEES ADAPTIVE CAPACITY AS A CORE FEATURE OF RESILIENT SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THE TWO APPROACHES CONVERGE IN IDENTIFYING NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF ADAPTATION. WE ARGUE THAT RESILIENCE PROVIDES A USEFUL FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE ADAPTATION PROCESSES AND TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE POLICY RESPONSES. WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN INCREMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS AND TRANSFORMATIVE ACTION AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SOURCES OF RESILIENCE FOR TAKING ADAPTIVE ACTION ARE COMMON ACROSS SCALES.

CHANGE-HUMAN POLICY DIMENS.,"THIS PAPER REVIEWS RESEARCH TRADITIONS OF VULNERABILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND THE CHALLENGES FOR PRESENT VULNERABILITY RESEARCH IN INTEGRATING WITH THE DOMAINS OF RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION. VULNERABILITY IS THE STATE OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HARM FROM EXPOSURE TO STRESSES ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CHANGE AND FROM THE ABSENCE OF CAPACITY TO ADAPT. ANTECEDENT TRADITIONS INCLUDE THEORIES OF VULNERABILITY AS ENTITLEMENT FAILURE AND THEORIES OF HAZARD. EACH OF THESE AREAS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO PRESENT FORMULATIONS OF VULNERABILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS LINKED TO RESILIENCE. RESEARCH ON VULNERABILITY TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SPANS ALL THE ANTECEDENT AND SUCCESSOR TRADITIONS. THE CHALLENGES FOR VULNERABILITY RESEARCH ARE TO DEVELOP ROBUST AND CREDIBLE MEASURES, TO INCORPORATE DIVERSE METHODS THAT INCLUDE PERCEPTIONS OF RISK AND VULNERABILITY, AND TO INCORPORATE GOVERNANCE RESEARCH ON THE MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE VULNERABILITY AND PROMOTE ADAPTIVE ACTION AND RESILIENCE. THESE CHALLENGES ARE COMMON TO THE DOMAINS OF VULNERABILITY, ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE AND FORM COMMON GROUND FOR CONSILIENCE AND INTEGRATION. (C) 2006 ELSEVIER LTD.
