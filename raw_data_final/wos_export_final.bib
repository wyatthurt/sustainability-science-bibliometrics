Abstract = {{The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) is a prominent framework to understand
   socio-technical transitions, but its micro-foundations have remained
   under-developed. The paper's first aim is therefore to develop the MLP's
   theoretical micro-foundations, which are rooted in Social Construction
   of Technology, evolutionary economics and neoinstitutional theory. The
   second aim is to further identify crossovers between these theories. To
   achieve these goals, the paper analytically reviews the three theories,
   focusing on: (1) the relevance of each theory for transitions and the
   MLP, (2) the theory's conceptualisation of agency, (3) criticisms of
   each theory and subsequent conceptual elaborations (which prepare the
   ground for potential crossovers between them). Mobilizing insights from
   the analytical reviews, the paper articulates a multi-dimensional model
   of agency, which also provides a relational and processual
   conceptualization of ongoing trajectories in which actors are embedded.
   Specific conceptual linking points between the three theories are
   identified, leading to an understanding of socio-technical transitions
   as evolutionary, interpretive and conflictual processes.}},

Abstract = {{Safely achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement requires a
   worldwide transformation to carbon-neutral societies within the next 30
   y. Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are
   required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to
   avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth's climate system.
   Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping
   interventions (STIs) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly
   spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural
   reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as
   social tipping elements (STE5). STE5 are subdomains of the planetary
   socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place
   and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse
   gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a
   subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The STIs that could
   trigger the tipping of STE subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel
   subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation (STE1,
   energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral
   cities (STE2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to
   fossil fuels (STE3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral
   implications of fossil fuels (STE4, norms and value systems), 5)
   strengthening climate education and engagement (STE5, education system),
   and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions (STE6,
   information feedbacks). Our research reveals important areas of focus
   for larger-scale empirical and modeling efforts to better understand the
   potentials of harnessing social tipping dynamics for climate change
   mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this research is to evaluate the contributions of Green
   Chemistry as a potential tool to drive the transition to circularity.
   For this, we have carried out a bibliographic study, analyzing those
   documents, process, or experiences that dealt jointly with the Green
   Chemistry aspects related to circularity such circular economy,
   industrial ecology, and closed loop. Findings show that few authors have
   treated that disciplines together in the last 10 years. Based on an
   analysis of academic literature, common strategies (design, raw
   materials, life cycle assessment, processes, normative, new business,
   and collaboration), specific experiences (catalyst, biobased products
   ormethods, recycling, and reusing), and difficulties to overcome
   (metrics, transdisciplinary research, unawareness, and competitiveness)
   have been identified. Finally, different kind ofmeasures, as behind such
   joint metrics, informal open spaces, closer the industry, education,
   standards and label are proposed to facilitate the development of Green
   Chemistry, circular economy, industrial ecology, and closed loop with
   the ultimate goal of improving sustainable development.
   From the evidences found, we finally conclude that it is possible to use
   Green Chemistry and its principles as a tool to drive the transition to
   circularity, being the development of open spaces for exchange
   information between different actors fromacademia, governments and
   regulatory actors, business and industrial sectors, with the aim of
   promoting disruptive advances in sustainability.}},

   feedstocks, and manufacturing processes will need to integrate the
   principles of green chemistry and green engineering under an expanded
   definition of performance that includes sustainability considerations.

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-84}},

Abstract = {{Forest transitions occur when net reforestation replaces net
   deforestation in places. Because forest transitions can increase
   biodiversity and augment carbon sequestration, they appeal to
   policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss and
   climate change. What then can policymakers do to trigger forest
   transitions? The historical record over the last two centuries provides
   insights into the precipitating conditions. The early transitions often
   occurred passively, through the spontaneous regeneration of trees on
   abandoned agricultural lands. Later forest transitions occurred more
   frequently after large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred
   governments to take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped
   lands. To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest
   transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with clearly
   articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover. These historical
   shifts in forest transitions reflect our growing appreciation of their
   utility for countering droughts, floods, land degradation, and climate
   change.}},

   pumped to irrigate 613,000 ha of rainfed agricultural land in the Terai
   plains, with a potential direct economic gain of USD 1.1 billion
   annually and associated benefits including promotion of energy-based
   industry, food security and local employment. Governance also plays an

Abstract = {{The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s,
   driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per
   capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever
   before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global
   declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of
   local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and
   the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital
   benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of
   life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy
   and the costs of reducing nature's benefits are unequally distributed.
   The fabric of life on which we all depend-nature and its contributions
   to people-is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats
   and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities
   exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such
   action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic,
   social, and technological causes of nature's deterioration.}},

   redistributing and reorienting power in socio-material change}},
Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines a variety of theories bearing on `socio-material
   incumbency' and explores methodological implications. The aim is to
   develop a systematic general approach, which builds on strengths and
   mitigates weaknesses in prevailing analytical frameworks. A particular
   priority lies in avoidance of self-acknowledged tendencies in existing
   theory to `reify' central notions like `the regime'. Such pictures may
   overstate the tractability of incumbency to conventional policy
   instruments and so inadvertently help reinforce it. Based on detailed
   analysis of ways in which longstanding concepts of structuration apply
   to socio-material change, a novel `configuring fields' approach is
   proposed. Contrasting `eagle-eye' and `worm-eye' views are each shown to
   yield distinctive possible `topologies of incumbency'. This results in
   testable hypotheses with potentially important practical implications.
   Attention can thus extend beyond narrow policy instruments and mixes, to
   fully embrace broader and deeper kinds of political collective action,
   culture change and democratic struggle.}},

Title = {{Power in global governance: an expanded typology from global health}},
Journal = {{GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1, 1}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The exercise of power permeates global governance processes, making
   power a critical concept for understanding, explaining, and influencing
   the intersection of global governance and health. This article briefly
   presents and discusses three well-established conceptualizations of
   power-Dahl's, Bourdieu's, and Barnett and Duvall's-from different
   disciplines, finding that each is important for understanding global
   governance but none is sufficient. The conceptualization of power itself
   needs to be expanded to include the multiple ways in which one actor can
   influence the thinking or actions of others. I further argue that global
   governance processes exhibit features of complex adaptive systems, the
   analysis of which requires taking into account multiple types of power.
   Building on established frameworks, the article then offers an expanded
   typology of eight kinds of power: physical, economic, structural,
   institutional, moral, discursive, expert, and network. The typology is
   derived from and illustrated by examples from global health, but may be
   applicable to global governance more broadly. Finally, one seemingly
   contradictory - and cautiously optimistic - conclusion emerges from this
   typology: multiple types of power can mutually reinforce tremendous
   power disparities in global health; but at the same time, such
   disparities are not necessarily absolute or immutable. Further research
   on the complex interaction of multiple types of power is needed for a
   better understanding of global governance and health.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Creating a just and sustainable planet will require not only small
   changes, but also systemic transformations in how humans relate to the
   planet and to each other, i.e., social-ecological transformations. We
   suggest there is a need for collaborative environments where
   experimentation with new configurations of social-ecological systems can
   occur, and we refer to these as transformative spaces. In this paper, we
   seek a better understanding of how to design and enable the creation of
   transformative spaces in a development context. We analyse nine case
   studies from a previous special issue on Designing Transformative Spaces
   that aimed to collect examples of cutting-edge action-oriented research
   on transformations from the Global South. The analysis showed five
   design phases as being essential: Problem Definition Phase;
   Operationalisation Phase; Tactical Phase; Outcome Phase; and Reflection
   Phase. From this synthesis, we distilled five key messages that should
   be considered when designing research, including: (a) there are ethical
   dilemmas associated with creating a transformative space in a system;
   (b) it is important to assess the readiness of the system for change
   before engaging in it; (c) there is a need to balance between `safe' and
   `safe-enough' spaces for transformation; (d) convening a transformative
   space requires an assemblage of diverse methodological frameworks and
   tools; and (e) transformative spaces can act as a starting point for
   institutionalising transformative change. Many researchers are now
   engaging in transdisciplinary transformations research, and are finding
   themselves at the knowledge-action interface contributing to
   transformative space-making. We hope that by analysing experiences from
   across different geographies we can contribute towards better
   understanding of how to navigate the processes needed for the urgent
   global transformations that are being called for to create a more
   equitable and sustainable planet Earth.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATIC CHANGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{61-80}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The field of climate services has arisen rapidly out of a desire to
   enable climate science to meet the information needs of society to
   respond to climate variability and change. In order for knowledge to be
   ``usable{''} for decision-making, in the field of climate adaptation and
   beyond, it must meet the criteria of credibility, salience, and
   legitimacy (Cash et al., PNAS 100:8086-8091, 2003). Deliberate
   ``co-production{''} of knowledge between ``producers{''} and ``users{''}
   has the potential to increase usability for decision-making and policy
   in some contexts. While co-production is increasingly advanced as an
   instrumental approach to facilitate the production of usable climate
   services, such efforts have paid scant attention to the role of power
   relations. In this article, we bring together literature on normative
   approaches to co-production-which treats co-production as an
   instrumental means to an end-with analytical interpretations of
   co-production within the field of Science and Technology Studies to
   examine efforts to develop usable climate services in Tanzania. We show
   that without reflexive processes that are explicitly attentive to power
   dynamics, normative co-production within climate services development
   can serve to reinforce, rather than overcome, power imbalances among
   actors.}},

Abstract = {{Remote less-favored agricultural lands (LFAL) are regions in developing
   countries that face severe biophysical constraints on production and are
   in geographical locations that have limited market access. We estimate
   that, across developing countries, 130 million people with high infant
   mortality live in such areas, and the incidence is 40\%. In low-income
   countries, the population in remote LFAL with high infant mortality
   increased 25\% over 2000-2010 to 57 million, and the incidence is 94\%.
   From case study evidence, we identify the key environmental and economic
   characteristics that influence the ability of rural households in remote
   LFAL to avoid poverty. We incorporate these characteristics in a model
   analyzing the behavior of a representative household, which illustrates
   conditions that enable the household to escape subsistence-level
   poverty. We also show empirically for 83 developing countries that the
   share of rural population on remote LFAL in 2000 affects the
   poverty-reducing impacts of per capita income growth over 2000-2012.}},

Title = {{Elite power in low-carbon transitions: A critical and interdisciplinary
   review}},
Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{57}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Modern energy systems have tended towards centralized control by states,
   and national and multinational energy companies. This implicates the
   power of elites in realizing low-carbon transitions. In particular,
   low-carbon transitions can create, perpetuate, challenge, or entrench
   the power of elites. Using a critical lens that draws from geography,
   political science, innovation studies, and social justice theory (among
   others), this article explores the ways in which transitions can
   exacerbate, reconfigure or be shaped by ``elite power.{''} It does so by
   offering a navigational approach that surveys a broad collection of
   diverse literatures on power. It begins by conceptualizing power across
   a range of academic disciplines, envisioning power as involving both
   agents (corrective influence) and structures (pervasive influence). It
   then elaborates different types of power and the interrelationship
   between different sources of power, with a specific focus on elites,
   including conceptualizing elite power, resisting elite power, and power
   frameworks. The Review then examines scholarship relevant to elite power
   in low-carbon transitions-including the multi-level perspective, Michel
   Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Anthony Giddens, Karl Marx, and other
   contextual approaches-before offering future research directions. The
   Review concludes that the power relations inherent in low-carbon
   transitions are asymmetrical but promisingly unstable. By better
   grappling with power analytically, descriptively, and even normatively,
   socially just and sustainable energy futures become not only more
   desirable but also more possible.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability studies educators in colleges and universities must
   identify and teach the knowledge, skills, and abilities their graduates
   will most need to advance sustainability while confronting perhaps the
   most serious, sweeping, and integrated set of challenges humanity has
   ever known. Using a rigorous grounded theory and hermeneutics based
   analysis/synthesis of the relevant literature, this study articulates
   and describes in depth a set of five competencies for the sustainability
   field and suggests potentially effective pedagogies for teaching them.
   Findings in the areas of both competencies and pedagogies for
   sustainability education imply the benefits of integrative, active,
   collaborative, and applied approaches to curriculum development and
   teaching-approaches that directly involve students in learning and
   practicing transdisciplinary engagement in service to sustainability.
   The Bachelor of Arts in Sustainability Studies program at Colorado
   Mountain College serves as an example of how the articulated competency
   framework is being applied to evaluate and enhance curriculum and
   learning outcomes. The competency framework and pedagogical
   recommendations offered may also serve as roadmaps for educators at
   other institutions who prepare graduates to address the pressing
   challenges of sustainability evident in communities, nations, and the
   world.}},

Abstract = {{Recognizing the importance of the second-best nature of economies, the
   Stern-Stiglitz report on carbon pricing departed from the recommendation
   of a single carbon price for all uses at all places and times. This
   paper provides some of the analytics behind these recommendations.
   First, I analyze the circumstances in which distributional concerns make
   desirable a tax or regulation inducing significant reductions in carbon
   usage in a carbon intensive sector for which consumers are
   disproportionately rich. Such policies allow lower carbon prices
   elsewhere without exceeding carbon emission targets. The cost of the
   resulting production inefficiency may, under the identified
   circumstances, be less than the distributional benefits. The paper
   considers the circumstances in which such differential policies may be
   best implemented through regulation vs. differential pricing, as well as
   differential effects on political economy and norm setting. Second, I
   consider the effect of carbon price trajectories on induced innovation,
   providing general conditions under which the optimal carbon path should,
   at least eventually, be falling over time. Finally, I revisit the
   price-versus-quantity debate and highlight important aspects of the
   dynamic nature of the problem. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability within planetary boundaries requires concerted action by
   individuals, governments, civil society and private actors. For the
   private sector, there is concern that the power exercised by
   transnational corporations generates, and is even central to, global
   environmental change. Here, we ask under which conditions transnational
   corporations could either hinder or promote a global shift towards
   sustainability. We show that a handful of transnational corporations
   have become a major force shaping the global intertwined system of
   people and planet. Transnational corporations in agriculture, forestry,
   seafood, cement, minerals and fossil energy cause environmental impacts
   and possess the ability to influence critical functions of the
   biosphere. We review evidence of current practices and identify six
   observed features of change towards `corporate biosphere stewardship',
   with significant potential for upscaling. Actions by transnational
   corporations, if combined with effective public policies and improved
   governmental regulations, could substantially accelerate sustainability
   efforts.}},

   variability) at that location. Anthropogenic climate change is now
   adding strong trends on top of existing natural variability. These
   trends elevate the frequency of ``surprises{''}-conditions that are
   unexpected based on recent history. Here, we show that the frequency of
   surprising ocean temperatures has increased even faster than expected
   based on recent temperature trends. Using a simple model of human
   adaptation, we show that these surprises will increasingly challenge
   natural modes of adaptation that rely on historical experience. We also
   show that warming rates are likely to shift natural communities toward
   generalist species, reducing their productivity and diversity. Our work
   demonstrates increasing benefits for individuals and institutions from
   betting that trends will continue, but this strategy represents a
   radical shift that will be difficult for many to make.}},

   Imagination in Intergovernmental Science-Policy Scenario Processes}},
Journal = {{ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Scenario development has been recognized as a potential method to
   explore future change and stimulate a reflective process that can
   contribute to more informed decision-making. The assessment process
   under IPBES (the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
   Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) has however shown that the current
   predominantly biophysical and economic models and scenario processes for
   exploring the future of biodiversity, ecosystem services and their
   contributions to human wellbeing are insufficient to capture the
   complexity and context-specific nature of the problems facing these
   sectors. Several important challenges have been identified that require
   a more in-depth analysis of where more imaginative scenario efforts can
   be undertaken to address this gap. In this paper, we identify six key
   characteristics necessary for scenario processes: adaptability across
   diverse contexts, inclusion of diverse knowledge and value systems,
   legitimate stakeholder engagement that foregrounds the role of power and
   politics, an ability to grapple with uncertainty, individual and
   collective thinking mechanisms and relevance to policy making. We
   compared four cases of imaginative, arts-based scenario processes that
   each offer aspects of meeting these criteria. These approaches emphasise
   the importance of engaging the imagination of those involved in a
   process and harnessing it as a tool for identifying and conceptualising
   more transformative future trajectories. Drawing on the existing
   literature, we argue that there is value in fostering more inclusive and
   creative participatory processes that acknowledge the importance of
   understanding multiple value systems and relationships in order to
   reimagine a more inclusive and just future. Based on this, we reflect on
   future research to understand the transformative role that imagination
   can play in altering and enhancing knowledge-making for global
   assessments, including IPBES. We conclude that creative scenario
   co-development processes that promote imagination and create an opening
   for more empathetic responses should be considered as complementary
   tools within the suite of methodologies used for future IPBES scenario
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The imperative to ``link knowledge and action{''} is widely invoked as a
   defining characteristic of sustainability research. The complexities of
   sustainability challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss
   mean that linear models of knowledge and action, where knowledge is
   produced first (by researchers) then ``applied to{''} action (by policy
   actors), are considered insufficient. Researchers have developed more
   dynamic, open-ended and collaborative forms of policy engagement such as
   transdisciplinary and co-production research. Although promising these
   approaches often remain captive to linear assumptions that hinder their
   transformative potential. We contribute by providing a relational model
   of knowledge and action rooted in contemporary practice theory. A
   practice-based approach suggests the primary task of participants in
   transdisciplinary interventions is to find workable solutions to
   situations of dynamic complexity that are fundamentally indeterminate
   and unpredictable. Knowledge is not ``applied to{''} action, but drawn
   upon, produced and used from within the situation at hand, allowing
   researchers and policy actors alike to better harness the emergent
   character of situational developments and outcomes. A practice-based
   approach provides a conceptual language that captures the experienced
   complexities of intervening for sustainability, reconfigures the nature
   of ``actionable knowledge,{''} and identifies appropriate modes of
   evaluation for transdisciplinary and co-produced research.}},

Title = {{Capturing emergent phenomena in social-ecological systems: an analytical
   framework}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex adaptive systems.
   Social-ecological system phenomena, such as regime shifts,
   transformations, or traps, emerge from interactions among and between
   human and nonhuman entities within and across scales. Analyses of SES
   phenomena thus require approaches that can account for (1) the
   intertwinedness of social and ecological processes and (2) the ways they
   jointly give rise to emergent social-ecological patterns, structures,
   and dynamics that feedback on the entities and processes that generated
   them. We have developed a framework of linked action situations (AS) as
   a tool to capture those interactions that are hypothesized to have
   jointly and dynamically generated a social-ecological phenomenon of
   interest. The framework extends the concept of an action situation to
   provide a conceptualization of SES that focusses on social-ecological
   interactions and their links across levels. The aim of our SE-AS
   (social-ecological action situations) framework is to support a process
   of developing hypotheses about configurations of ASs that may explain an
   emergent social-ecological phenomenon. We suggest six social-ecological
   ASs along with social and ecological action situations that can commonly
   be found in natural resource or ecosystem management contexts. We test
   the ability of the framework to structure an analysis of processes of
   emergence by applying it to different case studies of regime shifts,
   traps, and sustainable resource use. The framework goes beyond existing
   frameworks and approaches, such as the SES framework or causal loop
   diagrams, by establishing a way of analyzing SES that focuses on the
   interplay of social-ecological interactions with the emergent outcomes
   they produce. We conclude by discussing the added value of the framework
   and discussing the different purposes it can serve: from supporting the
   development of theories of the emergence of social-ecological phenomena,
   enhancing transparency of SES understandings to serving as a boundary
   object for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.}},

Title = {{Exploring the usefulness of scenario archetypes in science-policy
   processes: experience across IPBES assessments}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Scenario analyses have been used in multiple science-policy assessments
   to better understand complex plausible futures. Scenario archetype
   approaches are based on the fact that many future scenarios have similar
   underlying storylines, assumptions, and trends in drivers of change,
   which allows for grouping of scenarios into typologies, or archetypes,
   facilitating comparisons between a large range of studies. The use of
   scenario archetypes in environmental assessments foregrounds important
   policy questions and can be used to codesign interventions tackling
   future sustainability issues. Recently, scenario archetypes were used in
   four regional assessments and one ongoing global assessment within the
   Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services (IPBES). The aim of these assessments was to provide decision
   makers with policy-relevant knowledge about the state of biodiversity,
   ecosystems, and the contributions they provide to people. This paper
   reflects on the usefulness of the scenario archetype approach within
   science-policy processes, drawing on the experience from the IPBES
   assessments. Using a thematic analysis of (a) survey data collected from
   experts involved in the archetype analyses across IPBES assessments, (b)
   notes from IPBES workshops, and (c) regional assessment chapter texts,
   we synthesize the benefits, challenges, and frontiers of applying the
   scenario archetype approach in a science-policy process. Scenario
   archetypes were perceived to allow syntheses of large amounts of
   information for scientific, practice-, and policy-related purposes,
   streamline key messages from multiple scenario studies, and facilitate
   communication of them to end users. In terms of challenges, they were
   perceived as subjective in their interpretation, oversimplifying
   information, having a limited applicability across scales, and
   concealing contextual information and novel narratives. Finally, our
   results highlight what methodologies, applications, and frontiers in
   archetype-based research should be explored in the future. These
   advances can assist the design of future large-scale
   sustainability-related assessment processes, aiming to better support
   decisions and interventions for equitable and sustainable futures.}},

Abstract = {{The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on
   Climate Change call for deep transformations in every country that will
   require complementary actions by governments, civil society, science and
   business. Yet stakeholders lack a shared understanding of how the 17
   SDGs can be operationalized. Drawing on earlier work by The World in
   2050 initiative, we introduce six SDG Transformations as modular
   building-blocks of SDG achievement: (1) education, gender and
   inequality; (2) health, well-being and demography; (3) energy
   decarbonization and sustainable industry; (4) sustainable food, land,
   water and oceans; (5) sustainable cities and communities; and (6)
   digital revolution for sustainable development. Each Transformation
   identifies priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for
   actions by well-defined parts of government working with business and
   civil society. Transformations may therefore be operationalized within
   the structures of government while respecting the strong
   interdependencies across the 17 SDGs. We also outline an action agenda
   for science to provide the knowledge required for designing,
   implementing and monitoring the SDG Transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Social-ecological network (SEN) concepts and tools are increasingly used
   in human-environment and sustainability sciences. We take stock of this
   budding research area to further show the strength of SEN analysis for
   complex human-environment settings, identify future synergies between
   SEN and wider human-environment research, and provide guidance about
   when to use different kinds of SEN approaches and models. We
   characterize SEN research along a spectrum specifying the degree of
   explicit network representation of system components and dynamics. We
   then systematically review one end of this spectrum, what we term `fully
   articulated SEN' studies, which specifically model unique social and
   ecological units and relationships. Results show a larger number of
   papers focus on methodological advancement and applied ends. While there
   has been some development and testing of theories, this remains an area
   for future work and would help develop SENs as a unique field of
   research, not just a method. Authors have studied diverse systems, while
   mainly focusing on the problem of social-ecological fit alongside a
   scattering of other topics. There is strong potential, however, to
   engage other issues central to human-environment studies. Analyzing the
   simultaneous effects of multiple social, environmental, and coupled
   processes, change over time, and linking network structures to outcomes
   are also areas for future advancement. This review provides a
   comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN research, a
   necessary step that can help scholars develop comparable cases and fill
   research gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Energy transitions are ongoing processes all over the world. While
   sustainable solutions are envisioned for the future, many societies are
   still under high-carbon and high-pollution energy regime borne by fossil
   fuels. How to design pathways towards sustainable energy transition has
   attracted worldwide concerns. Understanding the possible transition
   pathways of the energy system requires the integration of new energy
   technologies, environmental sciences, economics and management. This
   Special Issue of Journal of Cleaner Production targets to collect the
   latest research results on sustainable energy systems, discover
   innovative avenues and inspiring models and share knowledge on energy
   system modelling and management. In this paper, we identify 4 themes on
   sustainable energy transition pathways including: (1) Sustainable energy
   economics and management; (2) Renewable energy generation and
   consumption; (3) Environmental impacts of energy systems; and (4)
   Electric vehicle and energy storage. Theories, technologies, innovative
   models, and successful experiences are discussed accordingly. It is
   suggested that creative, robust and audacious strategies in governance,
   management and education are needed to boost sustainable energy
   transition across various scales and sectors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

   fundamental changes in (energy, transport, housing, agro-food) systems

   sustainability transformations, and reviews criticisms and seven recent
   elaborations of the MLP with regard to: (1) politics and power, (2)
   cultural discourse and framing struggles, (3) grassroots innovation, (4)
   multiple transition pathways, (5) incumbent firm resistance and
   reorientation, (6) destabilization and decline, (7) policy analysis.
   Mobilizing insights from the wider social sciences, these elaborations
   have nuanced and differentiated the understanding of socio-technical
   transitions to sustainability and made the MLP the central pillar of a

Abstract = {{The potential consequences of cross-scale systemic environmental risks
   with global effects are increasing. We argue that current descriptions
   of globally connected systemic risk poorly capture the role of
   human-environment interactions. This creates a bias towards solutions
   that ignore the new realities of the Anthropocene. We develop an
   integrated concept of what we denote Anthropocene risk-that is, risks
   that: emerge from human-driven processes; interact with global
   social-ecological connectivity; and exhibit complex, cross-scale
   relationships. To illustrate this, we use four cases: moisture recycling
   teleconnections, aquaculture and stranded assets, biome migration in the
   Sahel, and sea-level rise and megacities. We discuss the implications of
   Anthropocene risk across several research frontiers, particularly in the
   context of supranational power, environmental and social externalities
   and possible future Anthropocene risk governance. We conclude that
   decision makers must navigate this new epoch with new tools, and that
   Anthropocene risk contributes conceptual guidance towards a more
   sustainable and just future.}},

Title = {{Rethinking power and institutions in the shadows of neoliberalism (An
   introduction to a special issue of World Development)}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{133-146}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite the recognition that institutions matter for international
   development, the debates over institutional reforms tend to obscure the
   role of power. Neoliberal models of development are often promoted in
   terms of their technical merits and efficiency gains and rarely account
   for the multiple ways that social, economic and political power shape
   institutional design and institutional change. Even recent efforts to
   address power tend to conceptualize it too narrowly. This special issue
   seeks to rethink the role of power in institutional creation and change
   in the context of persistent neoliberalism. In the introduction, we
   synthesize the literature on the nature of power to develop a new
   conceptual framework-a power in institutions matrix-that highlights the
   multiple dimensions of power involved in institutional development and
   change. We argue that such a theoretically-informed mapping of power in
   institutions will enable scholars, practitioners, and citizen groups to
   go beyond the standard critiques in order to analyze the multifaceted
   effects of neoliberal institutional change. Our introduction draws on an
   extensive literature review as well as the special issue contributors
   who examine institutional change in a variety of policy sectors in
   Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North America. We find that a
   range of diverse local, national and transnational actors, with
   disparate access to power, negotiate institutional changes from above
   and below through overt imposition of and resistance to new rules,
   influence of agendas, and promotion of discourses. Neoliberalism thus
   creates a new distributive politics. The special issue thus offers a
   theoretically-grounded approach for linking international and domestic
   power differences to the process of institutional change, with a
   specific focus on equity and sustainability. In a departure from the
   current literature's focus on elite bargains, we showcase the efforts by
   less powerful groups to gain a foothold in decision-making processes.

   seemingly intractable common pool resource (CPR) problems. However,
   significant power imbalances can constrain the creation, adoption and
   implementation of socially and environmentally desirable policies. This
   study integrates theory on power with the institutional analysis and
   design (IAD) framework in order to provide a conceptual framework for
   examining power that is not captured through the IAD's focus on action
   situations. We examined the use of collaboration in CPR governance
   contexts characterized by significant power imbalances. Two Canadian
   collaborative processes that involve large energy industry interests
   were studied. We assessed the ability of these collaborative processes
   to address social and environmental goals. Results revealed significant
   hidden power dynamics related to inaction and non-decisions.
   Collaboration was unable to produce progressive outcomes because of i)
   the restriction of the collaborative agenda by powerful actors; ii)
   selective enforcement of rules; and; iii) a broader neoliberal context
   that inherently favoured increasing resource extraction. These findings
   indicate that the achievement of progressive social and environmental
   outcomes through collaboration is constrained where powerful resource
   industries are present as participants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Increasing global food demand, low grain reserves and climate change
   threaten the stability of food systems on national to global
   scales(1-5). Policies to increase yields, irrigation and tolerance of
   crops to drought have been proposed as stability-enhancing
   solutions(1,6,7). Here we evaluate a complementary possibility-that
   greater diversity of crops at the national level may increase the
   year-to-year stability of the total national harvest of all crops
   combined. We test this crop diversity-stability hypothesis using 5
   decades of data on annual yields of 176 crop species in 91 nations. We
   find that greater effective diversity of crops at the national level is
   associated with increased temporal stability of total national harvest.
   Crop diversity has stabilizing effects that are similar in magnitude to
   the observed destabilizing effects of variability in precipitation. This
   greater stability reflects markedly lower frequencies of years with
   sharp harvest losses. Diversity effects remained robust after
   statistically controlling for irrigation, fertilization, precipitation,
   temperature and other variables, and are consistent with the
   variance-scaling characteristics of individual crops required by
   theory(8,9) for diversity to lead to stability. Ensuring stable food
   supplies is a challenge that will probably require multiple solutions.
   Our results suggest that increasing national effective crop diversity
   may be an additional way to address this challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to address unsustainable global change is often attributed to
   failures in conventional environmental governance. Polycentric
   environmental governance-the popular alternative-involves many centres
   of authority interacting coherently for a common governance goal. Yet,
   longitudinal analysis reveals many polycentric systems are struggling to
   cope with the growing impacts, pace, and scope of social and

   appear, particularly in the treatment of power. Here we draw together
   diverse social science perspectives and research into a variety of cases
   to show how different types of power shape rule setting, issue
   construction, and policy implementation in polycentric governance. We
   delineate an important and emerging research agenda for polycentric
   environmental governance, integrating diverse types of power into

Abstract = {{Background: The Planetary Boundaries concept (PBc) has emerged as a key
   global sustainability concept in international sustainable development
   arenas. Initially presented as an agenda for global sustainability
   research, it now shows potential for sustainability governance. Weuse
   the fact that it is widely cited in scientific literature (>3500
   citations) and an extensively studied concept to analyse how it has been
   used and developed since its first publication. Design: From the
   literature that cites the PBc, we select those articles that have the
   terms `planetary boundaries' or `safe operating space' in either title,
   abstract or keywords. Weassume that this literature substantively
   engages with and develops the PBc. Results: Wefind that 6\% of the
   citing literature engages with the concept. Within this fraction of the
   literature we distinguish commentaries-that discuss the context and
   challenges to implementing the PBc, articles that develop the core
   biogeophysical concept and articles that apply the concept by
   translating to sub-global scales and by adding a human component to it.
   Applied literature adds to the concept by explicitly including society
   through perspectives of impacts, needs, aspirations and behaviours.
   Discussion: Literature applying the concept does not yet include the
   more complex, diverse, cultural and behavioural facet of humanity that
   is implied in commentary literature. Wesuggest there is need for a
   positive framing of sustainability goals-as a Safe Operating Space
   rather than boundaries. Key scientific challenges include distinguishing
   generalised from context-specific knowledge, clarifying which processes
   are generalizable and which are scalable, and explicitly applying
   complex systems' knowledge in the application and development of the
   PBc. Weenvisage that opportunities to address these challenges will
   arise when more human social dimensions are integrated, as we learn to
   feed the global sustainability vision with a plurality of bottom-up
   realisations of sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving effective, sustainable environmental governance requires a
   better understanding of the causes and consequences of the complex
   patterns of interdependencies connecting people and ecosystems within
   and across scales. Network approaches for conceptualizing and analysing
   these interdependencies offer one promising solution. Here, we present
   two advances we argue are needed to further this area of research: (i) a
   typology of causal assumptions explicating the causal aims of any given
   network-centric study of social-ecological interdependencies; (ii)
   unifying research design considerations that facilitate conceptualizing
   exactly what is interdependent, through what types of relationships and
   in relation to what kinds of environmental problems. The latter builds
   on the appreciation that many environmental problems draw from a set of
   core challenges that re-occur across contexts. We demonstrate how these
   advances combine into a comparative heuristic that facilitates
   leveraging case-specific findings of social-ecological interdependencies
   to generalizable, yet context-sensitive, theories based on explicit
   assumptions of causal relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Access to ecosystem services and influence on their management are
   structured by social relations among actors, which often occur across
   spatial scales. Such cross-scale social relations can be analysed
   through a telecoupling framework as decisions taken at local scales are
   often shaped by actors at larger scales. Analyzing these cross-scale
   relations is critical to create effective and equitable strategies to
   manage ecosystem services. Here, we develop an analytical framework
   -i.e. the `cross-scale influence-dependence framework'- to facilitate
   the analysis of power asymmetries and the distribution of ecosystem
   services among the beneficiaries. We illustrate the suitability of this
   framework through its retrospective application across four case
   studies, in which we characterize the level of dependence of multiple
   actors on a particular set of ecosystem services, and their influence on
   decision-making regarding these services across three spatial scales.
   The `cross-scale influence-dependence framework' can improve our
   understanding of distributional and procedural equity and thus support
   the development of policies for sustainable management of ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about the impact on large-scale earth systems have taken center
   stage in the scientific and economic analysis of climate change. The
   present study analyzes the economic impact of a potential disintegration
   of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS). The study introduces an approach that
   combines long-run economic growth models, climate models, and
   reduced-form GIS models. The study demonstrates that social cost-benefit
   analysis and damage-limiting strategies can be usefully extended to
   illuminate issues with major long-term consequences, as well as concerns
   such as potential tipping points, irreversibility, and hysteresis. A key
   finding is that, under a wide range of assumptions, the risk of GIS
   disintegration makes a small contribution to the optimal stringency of
   current policy or to the overall social cost of climate change. It finds
   that the cost of GIS disintegration adds less than 5\% to the social
   cost of carbon (SCC) under alternative discount rates and estimates of
   the GIS dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
   Ecosystem Services (IPBES) aims to bridge between science and policy by
   assessing and synthesizing diverse forms of knowledge about
   biodiversity. With its explicit ambition to include not just natural
   science, but also social science and humanities as well as indigenous
   and local knowledge systems, IPBES is operating as a pioneer in
   uncharted territory. This Review assesses the state of research on IPBES
   processes in order to identify the challenges and lessons to be drawn
   from its efforts to include different kinds of experts, stakeholders and
   knowledge systems. The Review discusses both procedural and substantive
   dimensions of inclusiveness and identifies a paradox between on the one
   hand IPBES' demand for diversity and on the other hand its aim of
   achieving consensus. Specifically, it illustrates how IPBES' orientation
   towards consensus in decision-making and in assessment work shapes and
   constrains diversity and inclusiveness. This finding has implications
   for environmental assessment processes within and beyond IPBES and
   suggests a need to open up procedures and practices of participation and
   inclusion in order to accommodate pluralism, contestation and
   incommensurable perspectives and knowledge systems.}},

Abstract = {{Research on sustainability transitions has expanded rapidly in the last
   ten years, diversified in terms of topics and geographical applications,
   and deepened with respect to theories and methods. This article provides
   an extensive review and an updated research agenda for the field,
   classified into nine main themes: understanding transitions; power,
   agency and politics; governing transitions; civil society, culture and
   social movements; businesses and industries; transitions in practice and
   everyday life; geography of transitions; ethical aspects; and
   methodologies. The review shows that the scope of sustainability
   transitions research has broadened and connections to established
   disciplines have grown stronger. At the same time, we see that the grand
   challenges related to sustainability remain unsolved, calling for
   continued efforts and an acceleration of ongoing transitions. Transition
   studies can play a key role in this regard by creating new perspectives,
   approaches and understanding and helping to move society in the

Abstract = {{The UN Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
   Development (herein, Agenda 30) and the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) offer both a set of aspirations for the kind of future we would
   like to see for the world and a suite of targets and indicators to
   support goal implementation. Goal 4 promotes quality education and
   Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However,
   creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been
   challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful
   assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across
   complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We
   then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous
   competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal
   competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal
   learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through
   exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use
   of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in
   achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We
   concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require
   individuals to acquire key competencies', aligning with notions of
   transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context
   specific competencies.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability science recognises the need to fully incorporate cultural
   and emotional dimensions of environmental change to understand how
   societies deal with and shape anticipated transformations, unforeseen
   risks and increasing uncertainties. The relationship between empathy and
   sustainability represents a key advance in understanding underpinning
   human-environment relations. We assert that lack of empathy for nature
   and for others limits motivations to conserve the environment and
   enhance sustainability. Critically, the relationship between empathy and
   sustainability is mediated by place and identity that constrain and
   shape empathy's role in pro-environmental sustainability behaviour. We
   review emerging evidence across disciplines and suggest a new model
   exploring interactions between place, identity and empathy for
   sustainability. There are emerging innovative methodological approaches

Abstract = {{With a range of potential pathways to a sustainable future compatible
   with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degrees C target, scenario analysis has
   emerged as a key tool in studies of climate change mitigation and

   (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs). Whilst mitigation
   scenarios (the Shared Policy Assumptions, or SPAS) have been developed
   for each SSP-RCP combination, describing the actions necessary to match
   the climate pathway of the RCP, there has not yet been a systematic
   approach to address whether and how these actions can be enabled in
   practice.
   We present a novel and transferable framework to understand society's
   capacity to achieve the 1.5 degrees C target, based on four
   participatory case studies using the SSP-RCP scenarios. The methodology
   builds on a framework for categorising different types of societal
   capitals and capacities and assessing their impact on the potential to
   implement different types of mitigation actions. All four case studies
   show that SSP1 has the highest potential to reach the target. Although
   environmental awareness is high in both SSP1 and SSP4, continued social
   inequalities in SSP4 restrict society's capacity to transform, despite
   economic growth. In the two least environmentally-aware SSPs, SSP3 and
   SSP5, the transformation potential is low, but the view on capitals and
   capacities nonetheless helps identify opportunities for actors to
   develop and implement mitigation actions.
   The study highlights that techno-economic assessments of climate
   strategies need to be complemented by consideration of the critical role
   played by social and human capital, and by societal capacity to mobilise
   and create these capitals despite different socio-economic trends. These
   capitals and capacities are essential to enable the rapid innovation,
   behavioural change and international co-ordination needed to achieve the
   1.5 degrees C target.}},

Abstract = {{Effective science communication requires assembling scientists with
   knowledge relevant to decision makers, translating that knowledge into
   useful terms, establishing trusted two-way communication channels,
   evaluating the process, and refining it as needed. Communicating Science
   Effectively: A Research Agenda {[}National Research Council (2017)]
   surveys the scientific foundations for accomplishing these tasks, the
   research agenda for improving them, and the essential collaborative
   relations with decision makers and communication professionals.
   Recognizing the complexity of the science, the decisions, and the
   communication processes, the report calls for a systems approach. This
   perspective offers an approach to creating such systems by adapting
   scientific methods to the practical constraints of science
   communication. It considers staffing (are the right people involved?),
   internal collaboration (are they talking to one another?), and external
   collaboration (are they talking to other stakeholders?). It focuses on
   contexts where the goal of science communication is helping people to
   make autonomous choices rather than promoting specific behaviors (e.g.,
   voter turnout, vaccination rates, energy consumption). The approach is
   illustrated with research in two domains: decisions about preventing
   sexual assault and responding to pandemic disease.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of climate change requires a rethinking of existing
   socio-geographical arrangements. This paper argues that the transition
   to `post-fossil urbanization' is hampered by the lack of positive
   imaginations of alternative possible urban futures and post-fossil city
   life. It asks the question why it is so difficult to conceive of new
   possible urban worlds, and tries to answer it by using the established
   concept of `imaginary' and introducing the concept of `technique of
   futuring'. The salience of the imaginary of the modern city is used as
   an example. The paper points at the International Society for
   Organization (ISO) and `living labs' as contemporary techniques of
   futuring, organizing urban futures. It then aims to recoup one's
   capacity to imagine alternative possible worlds and explores the role
   that academics can play in this endeavour.}},

Abstract = {{Societal transformation is one of the most topical concepts in
   sustainability research and policy-making. Used in many ways, it
   indicates that nonlinear systematic changes are needed in order to fully
   address global environmental and human development challenges. This
   paper explores what sustainability transformations mean for lay focus
   group participants in Cabo Verde, China, Fiji, Sweden, and the USA. Key
   findings include: (a) Tightly linked to interpersonal relationships,
   sustainability was seen as going beyond the Sustainable Development
   Goals to include a sense of belonging; (b) transformations were framed
   as fundamental changes from today's society, but most participants
   stated that transformation pathways need to splice new structures into
   the old; (c) new technologies are key engines of change. Yet, the most
   common drivers were awareness, education, and knowledge sharing; and (d)
   regardless of whether state-centric or decentralized governance was
   preferred, personal action was seen as essential. The focus groups
   displayed a shared understanding across the geographical settings; a
   common realization of profound sustainability predicaments facing
   societies across the world; and a desire for fundamental change towards
   a more sustainable way of life.}},

Abstract = {{In this final paper, the guest editors identify and discuss ten
   guidelines emerging from the papers in this Special Issue on
   Decision-Support Tools for Climate Change Adaptation. The guidelines are
   arranged under three headings: foundational, design and construction,
   and supporting sustainability in the long term. Under foundational, we
   address the need for co-operation with end users of decision-support
   resources, the contribution these resources can make to the formation of
   thriving communities of practice, and the match between the different
   types of decision support and user needs. Under design and construction,
   we point to the risk that policy settings will change over the multiple
   years required to build and publish complex decision-support resources,
   reducing the relevance of the final product. We discuss the need for
   innovative approaches to ensure visibility, credibility and hence
   uptake. Developers should be mindful of the requirements, resources and
   capabilities of potential users at all points in the design and build.
   We also suggest that decision-support resources may be transferable
   between sectors and locations, but the motivation should be around
   achieving excellence, and not just cost savings. Under supporting
   sustainability in the long term, we stress the need for evaluation and
   comparative studies of performance, leading to carefully documented
   updating and improvement of decision-support resources. Finally, in the
   conclusions, we look to the future. Can decision-support resources
   evolve successfully to meet the information and guidance requirements of
   the increasingly sophisticated adaptation practitioner community?}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this synthesis paper is to present the motivations and
   conceptual basis for research on socio-technical-ecological systems
   (STES), addressing the need for interdisciplinary studies targeting the
   technological mediation of human-environment relationships. The
   background is the very limited number of collaborations between scholars
   of social-ecological systems and sociotechnical systems (SES), despite
   repeated calls for bridging work. The synthesis builds on an in-depth
   review of previous literature, interdisciplinary exchanges, and
   empirical examples. The result is arguments for why a sociotechnical
   understanding of technology' is of central importance for SES studies,
   related to how technology: (1) mediates human-environment relationships;
   (2) brings ambivalence to these relationships; (3) enhances and
   transforms human agency and provides a source of constitutive power; (4)
   changes scalar relationships, enabling our interaction with and impact
   on the natural world across time and space. Furthermore, we present an
   STES analytical approach which starts from symmetrical attention to
   technology, society, and environment, specifically targeting interfaces
   and relationships of critical relevance for SES scholars, and address
   counterarguments that we have encountered. We conclude that a shift to
   STES research will enhance our knowledge of system interfaces that are
   often overlooked, opening further avenues for research and real-world
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Material flows-such as food trade-allow human societies to rely on
   natural resources available both locally and in other regions of the
   planet. Thus, in a globalized world, multiple pools of the same resource
   are often harvested by multiple users through a network of interactions.
   It is not clear to what extent the interconnectedness, structure and
   modularity (that is, when subsystems of nodes exhibit stronger internal
   connectivity) of such a network may affect the resilience of the system.
   Here, we develop a theoretical framework to investigate the impact of

Abstract = {{The current landscape of climate services represents a highly diverse
   and still growing range of programs, projects, and portals involved in
   developing and/or providing climate services at different administrative
   levels and spatial-temporal scales. The diversity of service producers,
   users, and policy arenas has created a highly heterogeneous data- and
   information-oriented service landscape, and the authors contend that the
   domain of climate services requires efforts toward agreed structures and
   forms of conceptualization, operationalization, and evaluation. It is
   proposed here that qualitative classification be applied into climate
   change adaptation products, services, and systems to better guide
   research, policy, and practice with a clear terminology and analysis
   framework. This differentiation allows the pinpointing of critical
   challenges associated with the production and application of
   climate-relevant information, as well as the identification of suitable
   metrics to assess the impact of climate services. The article concludes
   with recommendations to advance climate services into knowledge-action
   systems and increase their sustainability.}},

Title = {{The dark side of coproduction: do the costs outweigh the benefits for
   health research?}},
Journal = {{HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Coproduction, a collaborative model of research that
   includes stakeholders in the research process, has been widely advocated
   as a means of facilitating research use and impact. We summarise the
   arguments in favour of coproduction, the different approaches to
   establishing coproductive work and their costs, and offer some advice as
   to when and how to consider coproduction.
   Debate: Despite the multiplicity of reasons and incentives to coproduce,
   there is little consensus about what coproduction is, why we do it, what
   effects we are trying to achieve, or the best coproduction techniques to
   achieve policy, practice or population health change. Furthermore,
   coproduction is not free risk or cost. Tensions can arise throughout
   coproduced research processes between the different interests involved.
   We identify five types of costs associated with coproduced research
   affecting the research itself, the research process, professional risks
   for researchers and stakeholders, personal risks for researchers and
   stakeholders, and risks to the wider cause of scholarship. Yet, these
   costs are rarely referred to in the literature, which generally calls
   for greater inclusion of stakeholders in research processes, focusing
   exclusively on potential positives. There are few tools to help
   researchers avoid or alleviate risks to themselves and their
   stakeholders.
   Conclusions: First, we recommend identifying specific motivations for
   coproduction and clarifying exactly which outcomes are required for whom
   for any particular piece of research. Second, we suggest selecting
   strategies specifically designed to enable these outcomes to be
   achieved, and properly evaluated. Finally, in the absence of strong
   evidence about the impact and process of coproduction, we advise a
   cautious approach to coproduction. This would involve conscious and
   reflective research practice, evaluation of how coproduced research
   practices change outcomes, and exploration of the costs and benefits of
   coproduction. We propose some preliminary advice to help decide when
   coproduction is likely to be more or less useful.}},

Abstract = {{Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure is the largest
   environmental health risk factor in the United States. Here, we link
   PM2.5 exposure to the human activities responsible for PM2.5 pollution.
   We use these results to explore ``pollution inequity{''}: the difference
   between the environmental health damage caused by a racialethnic group
   and the damage that group experiences. We show that, in the United
   States, PM2.5 exposure is disproportionately caused by consumption of
   goods and services mainly by the non-Hispanic white majority, but
   disproportionately inhaled by black and Hispanic minorities. On average,
   non-Hispanic whites experience a ``pollution advantage{''}: They
   experience similar to 17\% less air pollution exposure than is caused by
   their consumption. Blacks and Hispanics on average bear a ``pollution
   burden{''} of 56\% and 63\% excess exposure, respectively, relative to
   the exposure caused by their consumption. The total disparity is caused
   as much by how much people consume as by how much pollution they
   breathe. Differences in the types of goods and services consumed by each
   group are less important. PM2.5 exposures declined similar to 50\%
   during 2002-2015 for all three racial-ethnic groups, but pollution
   inequity has remained high.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining safe operating spaces for exploited natural systems in the
   face of uncertainty is a key sustainability challenge. This challenge
   can be viewed as a problem in which human society must navigate in a
   limited space of acceptable futures in which humans enjoy sufficient
   well-being and avoid crossing planetary boundaries. A critical obstacle
   is the nature of society as a controller with endogenous dynamics
   affected by knowledge, values, and decision-making fallacies. We outline
   an approach for analyzing the role of knowledge infrastructure in
   maintaining safe operating spaces. Using a classic natural resource
   problem as an illustration, we find that a small safe operating space
   exists that is insensitive to the type of policy implementation, while
   in general, a larger safe operating space exists which is dependent on
   the implementation of the ``right{''} policy. Our analysis suggests the
   importance of considering societal response dynamics to varying policy
   instruments in defining the shape of safe operating spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Urban consumption patterns and lifestyles are increasingly important for
   the sustainability of cities today and in the future. However,
   considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behaviour and
   lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices
   are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the
   environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production and
   consumption-based approaches, particularly in the ``demand{''} areas of
   mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption
   and production patterns in cities, research needs to be
   transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation
   processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and
   approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities
   require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are
   generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change
   initiatives, citizen groups and informal sector representatives. We
   present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to
   understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and
   lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP
   transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning
   processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and
   institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale
   community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through
   three empirical case studies in cities which take an integrative
   approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions. (C)

Abstract = {{Environmental and resource governance models emphasize the importance of
   local community and civil society participation to achieve social equity
   and environmental sustainability goals. Yet authoritarian political
   formations often undermine such participation through violent repression
   of dissent. This article seeks to advance understandings of violence
   against environmental and community activists challenging authoritarian
   forms of environmental and resource governance through eco-populist
   struggles. Authoritarianism and populism entertain complex
   relationships, including authoritarian practices toward and within
   eco-populist movements. Examining a major agrarian conflict and the
   killing of a prominent Indigenous leader in Honduras, we point to the
   frequent occurrence of deadly repression within societies experiencing
   high levels of inequalities, historical marginalization of Indigenous
   and peasant communities, a liberalization of foreign and private
   investments in land-based sectors, and recent reversals in partial
   democratization processes taking place within a broader context of high
   homicidal violence and impunity rates. We conclude with a discussion of
   the implications of deadly repression on environmental and land
   defenders.}},

Abstract = {{The natural environment is now commonly viewed as a form of capital
   asset, or natural capital. Also included are ecosystems that provide
   important goods and services to the economy. Managing natural capital
   has consequences for sustainable development. However, there are
   contrasting weak versus strong sustainability views, which in turn have
   implications for green' accounting. Natural resource-based sovereign
   wealth funds have emerged as key financial instruments for compensating
   resource depreciation with greater economy-wide investments. Recent
   scientific evidence recommends demarcating safe operating spaces' to
   limit exploitation of critical global biophysical subsystems or
   processes. These challenges suggest that the concept of natural capital

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Recent high-level agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the
   Sustainable Development Goals aim at mitigating climate change,
   ecological degradation and biodiversity loss while pursuing social goals
   such as reducing hunger or poverty. Systemic approaches bridging natural
   and social sciences are required to support these agendas. The surging
   human use of biophysical resources (materials, energy) results from the
   pursuit of social and economic goals, while driving global environmental
   change. Sociometabolic research links the study of socioeconomic
   processes with biophysical processes and thus plays a pivotal role in
   understanding society-nature interactions. It includes a broad range of
   systems science approaches for measuring, analysing and modelling of
   biophysical stocks and flows as well as the services they provide to
   society. Here we outline and systematize major sociometabolic research
   traditions that study the biophysical basis of economic activity: urban
   metabolism, the multiscale integrated assessment of societal and
   ecosystem metabolism, biophysical economics, material and energy flow
   analysis, and environmentally extended input-output analysis. Examples
   from recent research demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of
   sociometabolic research. We discuss future research directions that
   could also help to enrich related fields.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Two of the most consequential developments affecting US politics are (1)
   the growing influence of private philanthropy, and (2) the large-scale
   production and diffusion of misinformation. Despite their importance,
   the links between these two trends have not been scientifically
   examined. This study employs a sophisticated research design on a large
   collection of new data, utilizing natural language processing and
   approximate string matching to examine the relationship between the
   large-scale climate misinformation movement and US philanthropy. The
   study finds that over a twenty year period, networks of actors
   promulgating scientific misinformation about climate change were
   increasingly integrated into the institution of US philanthropy. The
   degree of integration is predicted by funding ties to prominent
   corporate donors. These findings reveal new knowledge about large-scale
   efforts to distort public understanding of science and sow polarization.
   The study also contributes a unique computational approach to be applied
   at this increasingly important, yet methodologically fraught, area of
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Social and institutional diversity (diversity hereafter) are important
   dimensions in collaborative environmental governance, but lack empirical
   assessment. In this paper, we examine three aspects of diversity
   hypothesized in the literature as being important in collaborative forms
   of environmental governancethe presence of diverse actors, diverse
   perspectives, and diverse institutions. The presence of these aspects
   and formative conjectures were empirically considered using a mixed
   methods approach in four biosphere reserves in Sweden and Canada. We
   found that the diversity of actors involved and domains of authority
   varied among cases, that stakeholder perspectives were highly diverse in
   all cases, and that institutional variety (in terms of strategies,
   norms, and rules) was evident in all cases, but differed among them.
   Empirical support from the cases further affirms that diversity
   contributes to the ability to engage with a broader set of issues and
   challenges; diversity contributes to novel approaches to solving
   problems within the governance group; and diversity contributes to the
   flexibility of the group involved in governance in terms of addressing
   challenges. One conjecture, that diversity decreases the efficiency of
   governance in decision-making and responding to issues, was not
   supported by the data. However, our analysis indicates that there might
   be a trade-off between diversity and efficiency. The findings highlight
   differences in the ways in which diversity is conceptualized in the
   literature and on the ground, emphasizing the pragmatic advantages of
   actively seeking diversity in terms of competencies and capacities.}},

   theoretically equivalent under strong assumptions and reviews how and
   why the two approaches are taken. The two approaches are then applied to
   renewable energy capital (REC), which has rarely been done in either
   produced or natural capital accounting and sustainability assessments.
   Renewable energy capital provides an ideal example with which to compare
   the two approaches, as it is a class of produced capital that
   substitutes both produced and natural capital. The numerical results of
   both approaches demonstrate that renewable energy capital starts to
   account for as large a share as natural capital does, if not produced
   capital or inclusive wealth, in those countries where natural capital is
   poorly endowed and investment in renewable energy capital has been
   witnessed.}},

Abstract = {{The view that innovation is a key driver for sustainability is widely
   accepted among scholars, industry professionals, and government
   representatives. This is due to the fact that sustainable development is
   a pressing issue that requires immediate action and changes from
   governments, industry, and society as whole. This article reviews the
   literature on innovations that can lead to transformations in
   individuals, organizations, supply chains, and communities toward a
   sustainable future. Although many of the articles explored in this
   review report on existing urgent environmental and social issues, their
   findings, recommendations, and contributions are encouraging as we make
   progress toward a sustainable society through innovation and change.
   This article reviews the diversity of innovation for Sustainable
   Development in the literature, proposes a typology of such a phenomenon,
   provides an overview of key articles based on the primary subjects they
   address, and identifies a series of recommendations for the future

Pages = {{118-147}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{A growing scholarship on multistakeholder learning dialogues suggests
   the importance of closely managing learning processes to help
   stakeholders anticipate which policies are likely to be effective. Much
   less work has focused on how to manage effective transnational
   multistakeholder learning dialogues, many of which aim to help address
   critical global environmental and social problems such as climate change
   or biodiversity loss. They face three central challenges. First, they
   rarely shape policies and behaviors directly, but work to `nudge' or
   `tip the scales' in domestic settings. Second, they run the risk of
   generating `compromise' approaches incapable of ameliorating the
   original problem definition for which the dialogue was created. Third,
   they run the risk of being overly influenced, or captured, by powerful
   interests whose rationale for participating is to shift problem
   definitions or narrow instrument choices to those innocuous to their
   organizational or individual interests. Drawing on policy learning
   scholarship, we identify a six-stage learning process for anticipating
   effectiveness designed to minimize these risks while simultaneously
   fostering innovative approaches for meaningful and longlasting problem
   solving: Problem definition assessments; Problem framing; Developing
   coalition membership; Causal framework development; Scoping exercises;
   Knowledge institutionalization. We also identify six management
   techniques within each process for engaging transnational dialogues
   around problem solving. We show that doing so almost always requires
   anticipating multiple-step causal pathways through which influence of
   transnational and/or international actors and institutions might occur.}},

   Environmental Innovation}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{As a purposive sustainability transition requires environmental
   innovation and innovation policy, we discuss potentials and limitations
   of three dominant strands of literature in this field, namely the
   multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP), the
   innovation systems approach (IS), and the long-wave theory of
   techno-economic paradigm shifts (LWT). All three are epistemologically
   rooted in an evolutionary understanding of socio-technical change. While
   these approaches are appropriate to understand market-driven processes
   of change, they may be deficient as analytical tools for exploring and
   designing processes of purposive societal transformation. In particular,
   we argue that the evolutionary mechanism of selection is the key to
   introducing the strong directionality required for purposive
   transformative change. In all three innovation theories, we find that
   the prime selection environment is constituted by the market and, thus,
   normative societal goals like sustainability are sidelined.
   Consequently, selection is depoliticised and neither strong
   directionality nor incumbent regime destabilisation are societally
   steered. Finally, we offer an analytical framework that builds upon a
   more political conception of selection and retention and calls for new
   political institutions to make normatively guided selections.
   Institutions for transformative innovation need to improve the
   capacities of complex societies to make binding decisions in politically
   contested fields.}},

Title = {{Critical Commons Scholarship: A Typology}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1112-1127}},
Abstract = {{Common-pool resource theory (CPR theory) emerged to understand the
   limitations of the tragedy of the commons narrative, and the theory of
   human behavior underlying it. Over time, diverse critiques of CPR theory
   have also emerged. Prominent critiques include inattention to power and
   coercion, assumptions that institutions can be crafted, and analyses
   that exclude history and context, among others. We label this literature
   critical commons scholarship. In this review paper, we define a typology
   of five types of critical commons scholarship. The functionalist
   critique (type 1) argues that a narrow focus on institutions that
   excludes history, context, and contingencies causes erroneous
   conclusions about the causes of resource sustainability. The apolitical
   management critique (type 2) argues that a focus on resource
   sustainability causes commons scholars to ignore how power is used to
   create and maintain inequalities through rules and norms structuring
   resource access. The methodological critique (type 3) argues that
   methodological incompatibilities, such as CPR theory's dependence on
   general, abstract models, necessarily prevent these scholars from
   responding to type 1 and type 2 critiques. The project of government
   critique (type 4) argues that common-pool resource theory is used to
   support neoliberal and hegemonic practices. Finally, the ethical
   critique (type 5) argues that common-pool resource theory is premised on
   problematic north-south relationships where expert scholars in the
   global north provide information to be consumed by ``commoners{''} in
   the global south. Mainstream CPR theory has been limited in engaging
   with critical commons scholarship, but there are new tools (such as the
   social-ecological systems framework and the critical institutionalism
   approach) for addressing each type of critique. Our goal in developing
   this typology is to make critiques of CPR theory legible and potentially
   actionable, while acknowledging the challenges associated with
   addressing them.}},

Abstract = {{Co-production has become a cornerstone of research within the
   sustainability sciences, motivating collaborations of diverse actors to
   conduct research in the service of societal and policy change. This
   review examines theoretical and empirical literature from sustainability
   science, public administration, and science and technology studies (STS)
   with the intention of advancing the theory and practice of co-production
   within sustainability science. We argue that co-production must go
   beyond stakeholder engagement by scientists to the more deliberate
   design of societal transitions. Co-production can contribute to such
   transitions by shifting the institutional arrangements that govern
   relationships between knowledge and power, science and society, and
   state and citizens. We highlight critical weaknesses in
   conceptualizations of co-production within sustainability sciences with
   respect to power, politics, and governance. We offer suggestions for how
   this can be rectified through deeper engagement with public
   administration and STS to offer a broad vision for enhancing the use,
   design, and practice of a more reflexive co-production in sustainability
   science.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional top-down methods for resource management ask first what
   future conditions will be, then identify the best action(s) to take in
   response to that prediction. Even when acknowledging uncertainty about
   the future, standard approaches (a) characterize uncertainties
   probabilistically, then optimize objectives in expectation, and/or (b)
   develop a small number of representative scenarios to explore variation
   in outcomes under different policy responses. This leaves planners
   vulnerable to surprise if future conditions diverge from predictions. In
   this review, we describe contemporary approaches to decision support
   that address deep uncertainty about future external forcings, system
   responses, and stakeholder preferences for different outcomes. Many of
   these methods are motivated by climate change adaptation, infrastructure
   planning, or natural resources management, and they provide dramatic
   improvements in the robustness of management strategies. We outline
   various methods conceptually and describe how they have been applied in
   a range of landmark real-world planning studies.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental justice literature has found that the poor and people
   of color are disproportionately exposed to pollution. This literature
   has sparked a broad activist movement and several policy reforms in the
   United States and internationally. In this article, we review the
   literature documenting correlations between pollution and demographics
   and the history of the related movement, focusing on the United States.
   We then turn to the potential causal mechanisms behind the observed
   correlations. Given its focus on causal econometric models, we argue
   that economics has a comparative advantage in evaluating these
   mechanisms. We consider (a) profit-maximizing decisions by firms, (b)
   Tiebout-like utility-maximizing decisions by households in the presence
   of income disparities, (c) Coasean negotiations between both sides, (d)
   political economy explanations and governmental failures, and (e)
   intergenerational transmission of poverty. Proper identification of the
   causal mechanisms underlying observed disproportionate exposures is
   critical to the design of effective policy to remedy them.}},

   scholars. Rather than treating culture as a social sphere separate from
   politics and the economy, we conceptualize it as the ideas, values, and
   assumptions underpinning policies and practices in all spheres. We
   review recent research on movements' impacts on public opinion and
   everyday behavior; the media and popular culture; nonpolitical
   institutions such as science, medicine, and education; and politics. We
   focus on cultural impacts that have mattered for movements'
   constituencies and address why movements have had those impacts. We
   conclude with an agenda for future research, seeking greater connection
   between the literatures on movements and the literatures on the

Abstract = {{This article reviews the recent literature on the dynamics of global
   wealth inequality. I first reconcile available estimates of wealth
   inequality in the United States. Both surveys and tax data show that
   wealth inequality has increased dramatically since the 1980s, with a top
   1\% wealth share of approximately 40\% in 2016 versus 25-30\% in the
   1980s. Second, I discuss the fast-growing literature on wealth
   inequality across the world. Evidence points toward a rise in global
   wealth concentration: For China, Europe, and the United States combined,
   the top 1\% wealth share has increased from 28\% in 1980 to 33\% today,
   while the bottom 75\% share hovered around 10\%. Recent studies,
   however, may underestimate the level and rise of inequality, as
   financial globalization makes it increasingly hard to measure wealth at
   the top. I discuss how new data sources (leaks from financial
   institutions, tax amnesties, and macroeconomic statistics of tax havens)
   can be leveraged to better capture the wealth of the rich.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable consumption and production is identified as one of the
   essential requirements for sustainable development. Due to different
   economic conditions and socio-cultural factors, sustainable consumption
   and production requires a diverse focus in developing and developed
   economies. To date, few efforts have been made to systematically compare
   the status of sustainable consumption and production and its direction
   from the perspective of developing and developed economies. This paper
   provides a literature review of published articles in international
   scientific journals related to sustainable consumption and production
   between 1998 and 2018 inclusive. Three carefully designed questions are
   proposed and answered in this article, forming the basis for conducting
   a comprehensive comparative analysis of the differences and challenges
   in sustainable consumption and production practices within developed and
   developing economies. The findings strongly suggest that countries in
   Europe hold international leadership in sustainable consumption and
   production practices. This finding, alongside others, is analyzed and
   discussed in greater detail in this paper, resulting in the articulation
   of gaps and future research opportunities in the current body of the
   literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Regime shifts are large, abrupt, and persistent critical transitions in
   the function and structure of ecosystems. Yet, it is unknown how these
   transitions will interact, whether the occurrence of one will increase
   the likelihood of another or simply correlate at distant places. We
   explored two types of cascading effects: Domino effects create one-way
   dependencies, whereas hidden feedbacks produce two-way interactions. We
   compare them with the control case of driver sharing, which can induce
   correlations. Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that
   45\% of regime shift pairwise combinations present at least one
   plausible structural interdependence. The likelihood of cascading
   effects depends on cross-scale interactions but differs for each type.
   Management of regime shifts should account for potential connections.}},

Abstract = {{Current theoretical models of the commons assert that common-pool
   resources can only be managed sustainably with clearly defined
   boundaries around both communities and the resources that they use. In
   these theoretical models, open access inevitably leads to a tragedy of
   the commons. However, in many open access systems, use of common-pool
   resources seems to be sustainable over the long term (i.e., current
   resource use does not threaten use of common-pool resources for future
   generations). Here, we outline the conditions that support sustainable
   resource use in open property regimes. We use the conceptual framework
   of complex adaptive systems to explain how processes within and
   couplings between human and natural systems can lead to the emergence of
   efficient, equitable, and sustainable resource use. We illustrate these
   dynamics in eight case studies of different social-ecological systems,
   including mobile pastoralism, marine and freshwater fisheries, swidden
   agriculture, and desert foraging. Our theoretical framework identifies
   eight conditions that are critical for the emergence of sustainable use
   of common-pool resources in open property regimes. In addition, we
   explain how changes in boundary conditions may push open property
   regimes to either common property regimes or a tragedy of the commons.
   Our theoretical model of emergent sustainability helps us to understand
   the diversity and dynamics of property regimes across a wide range of
   social-ecological systems and explains the enigma of open access without
   a tragedy. We recommend that policy interventions in such
   self-organizing systems should focus on managing the conditions that are
   critical for the emergence and persistence of sustainability.}},

   perspectives that may lead to a reload of climate policy with buy-in

Title = {{Middle-range theories of land system change}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{52-67}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Changes in land systems generate many sustainability challenges.
   Identifying more sustainable land-use alternatives requires solid
   theoretical foundations on the causes of land-use/cover changes. Land
   system science is a maturing field that has produced a wealth of
   methodological innovations and empirical observations on land cover and
   land-use change, from patterns and processes to causes. We take stock of
   this knowledge by reviewing and synthesizing the theories that explain
   the causal mechanisms of land-use change, including systemic linkages
   between distant land-use changes, with a focus on agriculture and
   forestry processes. We first review theories explaining changes in
   land-use extent, such as agricultural expansion, deforestation, frontier
   development, and land abandonment, and changes in land-use intensity,
   such as agricultural intensification and disintensification. We then
   synthesize theories of higher-level land system change processes,
   focusing on: (i) land-use spillovers, including land sparing and rebound
   effects with intensification, leakage, indirect land-use change, and
   land-use displacement, and (ii) land-use transitions, defined as
   structural non-linear changes in land systems, including forest
   transitions. Theories focusing on the causes of land system changes span
   theoretically and epistemologically disparate knowledge domains and
   build from deductive, abductive, and inductive approaches. A grand,
   integrated theory of land system change remains elusive. Yet, we show
   that middle-range theories - defined here as contextual generalizations
   that describe chains of causal mechanisms explaining a well-bounded
   range of phenomena, as well as the conditions that trigger, enable, or
   prevent these causal chains -, provide a path towards generalized
   knowledge of land systems. This knowledge can support progress towards
   sustainable social-ecological systems.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{114-126}},

Abstract = {{The international research on the benefits of community-based natural
   resource management (CBNRM) regimes for sustainable development has
   raised concerns about the vulnerability of said regimes to
   globalization, shortsighted government regulations, marginalization, and
   other global political economy threats. This paper addresses the
   question of whether and how social movements contribute to the
   organization and robustness of CBNRM in the advent of those threats. To
   accomplish this, we carry out a qualitative meta-analysis of 81 cases
   worldwide. Our evidence shows that one of the most important effects of
   movements on CBNRM is the promotion and defense of community use and
   management rights against certain government decisions or actions by
   global corporations. We also find that movements can generate positive
   effects beyond the reaction to specific threats. Those effects include
   the democratization of communities' collective choice processes, the
   reinvigoration of identity ties and local ecological knowledge, the
   promotion of economic development and autonomy, and the creation of
   nested user organizations. Exploring such potentially longer-term
   effects is a promising next step towards further connecting the social
   movement and CBNRM scholarships and better understanding the robustness
   of local management regimes in the context of global change.}},

   describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple
   meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that
   reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as
   well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts.
   Stewardship may therefore be considered a `boundary object'; that is, a
   conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between
   different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception.
   This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the
   literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the
   challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide
   the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify
   four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic,
   Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for
   thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around
   three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to
   identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas
   for future stewardship research. In these efforts - and for scholars
   engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly - this paper can act
   as a helpful `centering device', connecting practitioners, policy-makers
   and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent
   framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are
   identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy
   discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a
   Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science
   and R\&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and
   address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second
   frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on
   competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation
   for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on
   building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning
   between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third
   frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as
   the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change
   is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames.
   Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised
   in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third
   framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its
   potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One
   key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the
   Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation
   model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are
   relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative
   innovation policy should be a priority.}},

Abstract = {{The topics addressed in this paper concern the (much-needed) transition
   to sustainability and what role (innovation) policy can play in speeding
   up such changes. In their Discussion Paper Schot and Steinmueller (2018)
   argue that the existing theorizing and knowledge bases within the field
   of innovation studies are ``unfit{''} for this task and that a totally
   new approach is required. This paper takes issue with this claim. Policy
   advice, it is argued, needs to be anchored in the accumulated research
   on the issue at hand, in this case, innovation. The paper therefore
   starts by distilling some important insights on innovation from the
   accumulated research on this topic and, with this in mind, considers
   various policy approaches that have been suggested for influencing
   innovation and sustainability transitions. Finally, the lessons for the
   development and implementation of transformative innovation policy are
   considered. It is concluded that the existing theorizing and knowledge
   base in innovation studies may be of great relevance when designing
   policies for dealing with climate change and sustainability transitions.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1533-1547}},

Abstract = {{The United Nations formulated the sustainable development goals (SDGs)
   in 2015 as a comprehensive global policy framework for addressing the
   most pressing social and environmental challenges currently facing
   humanity. In this paper, we analyse SDG 12, which aims to ensure
   sustainable consumption and production patterns. Despite long-standing
   political recognition of this objective, and ample scientific evidence
   both on its importance and on the efficacy of various ways of promoting
   it, the SDGs do not provide clear goals or effective guidance on how to
   accomplish this urgently needed transformation. Drawing from the growing
   body of research on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), the
   paper identifies two dominant vantage pointsone focused on promoting
   more efficient production methods and products (mainly through
   technological improvement and informed consumer choice) and the other
   stressing the need to consider also overall volumes of consumption,
   distributional issues, and related social and institutional changes. We
   label these two approaches efficiency and systemic. Research shows that
   while the efficiency approach contains essential elements of a
   transition to sustainability, it is by itself highly unlikely to bring
   about sustainable outcomes. Concomitantly, research also finds that
   volumes of consumption and production are closely associated with
   environmental impacts, indicating a need to curtail these volumes in
   ways that safeguard social sustainability, which is unlikely to be
   possible without a restructuring of existing socioeconomic arrangements.
   Analysing how these two perspectives are reflected in the SDGs
   framework, we find that in its current conception, it mainly relies on
   the efficiency approach. On the basis of this assessment, we conclude
   that the SDGs represent a partial and inadequate conceptualisation of
   SCP which will hamper implementation. Based on this determination, this
   paper provides some suggestions on how governments and other actors
   involved in SDGs operationalisation could more effectively pursue SCP
   from a systemic standpoint and use the transformation of systems of
   consumption and production as a lever for achieving multiple
   sustainability objectives.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We compare two rationales for the management of social-ecological
   systems under uncertainty: control and resilience. The first focuses at
   system performance, the second at system capacity to cope with change.
   The two schools of thought promote their own legitimacy, but undertake
   little effort to transcend their own perspective. Though, different
   scholars have pointed at the necessity of combining control and
   resilience for managing a system. We review the literature on control
   and resilience, synthesize the work in these fields into one coherent
   conceptual framework and reflect on the question whether control and
   resilience strategies can be reconciled or whether inevitable trade-offs
   are to be made. Based on a literature review, we develop a framework
   contrasting both rationales through their preferred (contrary) system
   attributes. Next, we discuss the operationalization of these system
   properties for policy development. Policies will generally reflect
   elements of both control and resilience. There will be trade-offs
   between preferred system attributes, where development of resilience
   restricts the development of possible control (and vice versa). The
   conceptual framework introduced provides a `language' for contrasting
   and possibly (partly) reconciling the control and resilience rationales.
   Such a language is crucial for a meaningful policy discourse between
   actors, because it helps in understanding the implications of different
   rationales and in comparing alternative policies in terms of control and
   resilience.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A contemporary challenge is inequality. This paper illustrates why ideas
   matter, and how they can change over time. Inequalities are reinforced
   when they are taken for granted. But this can be disrupted when
   marginalised people gain self-esteem; challenge hitherto unquestioned
   inequalities; and gain confidence in the possibility of social change.
   Slowly and incrementally, social mobilisation can catalyse greater
   government commitment to socially inclusive economic growth. This is
   illustrated with ethnographic research from Latin America, where income
   inequality has recently declined. Clearly, however, no single paper can
   provide a comprehensive account of political change in an incredibly
   diverse region. By highlighting some ways in which ideas matter (and the
   limitations of alternative hypotheses about increased fiscal space and
   democratisation), this paper merely seeks to persuade political
   economists to go beyond `incentives'. Future efforts to tackle
   inequality might harness the power of ideas: tackling `norm perceptions'
   (beliefs about what others think and do); publicising positive deviance;
   and strengthening social movements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In acknowledgement of the complexity of environmental challenges,
   research on learning in environmental policy has grown substantially
   over the past two decades across a range of disciplines. Despite this
   growth, there are few comprehensive assessments of the literature on
   learning in environmental policy. This article fills this gap by
   providing insights on the overall coherence and impact of this body of
   scholarship. To do so, we analyze a sample of 163 articles from 2004 to
   2014 using a standardized coding framework. The results provide an
   in-depth assessment of the status of the literature on learning in the
   context of environmental policy, as well as the quality of the
   literature. We demonstrate that despite the diversity in research
   questions and goals, the literature is lacking with respect to diversity
   in cases and context, theoretical development, clear conceptualization
   and operationalization of learning, and advancements in empirical
   approaches to study learning. From these insights, we discuss the
   challenges and opportunities for scholars in studying learning and
   provide recommendations for building the theoretical and methodological
   rigor of the field.}},

Abstract = {{Many global challenges, though interconnected, have been addressed
   singly, at times reducing one problem while exacerbating others. Nexus
   approaches simultaneously examine interactions among multiple sectors.
   Recent quantitative studies have revealed that nexus approaches can
   uncover synergies and detect trade-offs among sectors. If well
   implemented, nexus approaches have the potential to reduce negative
   surprises and promote integrated planning, management and governance.
   However, application and implementation of nexus approaches are in their
   infancy. No studies have explicitly quantified the contributions of
   nexus approaches to progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development
   Goals. To further implement nexus approaches and realize their
   potential, we propose a systematic procedure and provide perspectives on
   future directions. These include expanding nexus frameworks that
   consider interactions among more sectors, across scales, between
   adjacent and distant places, and linkages with Sustainable Development
   Goals; incorporating overlooked drivers and regions; diversifying nexus
   toolboxes; and making these strategies central in policy-making and
   governance for integrated Sustainable Development Goal implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Approval of hierarchy and inequality in society indexed by social
   dominance orientation (SDO) extends to support for human dominance over
   the natural world. We tested this negative association between SDO and
   environmentalism and the validity of the new Short Social Dominance
   Orientation Scale in two cross-cultural samples of students (N = 4,163,
   k = 25) and the general population (N = 1,237, k = 10). As expected, the
   higher people were on SDO, the less likely they were to engage in
   environmental citizenship actions, pro-environmental behaviors and to
   donate to an environmental organization. Multilevel moderation results
   showed that the SDO-environmentalism relation was stronger in societies
   with marked societal inequality, lack of societal development, and
   environmental standards. The results highlight the interplay between
   individual psychological orientations and social context, as well as the
   view of nature subscribed to by those high in SDO.}},

Abstract = {{Present trends of urbanization are accompanied by increasing demographic
   and economic shrinkage of rural regions. In countries such as Japan,
   these rural regions trail behind metropolitan counterparts according to
   GDP, the conventional measure used to guide governmental policies. Yet,
   past research suggests that these regions may be undervalued. Further,
   the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), largely only used at the national
   level, may be able to capture aspects previously missed. As such, our
   study attempts to highlight the wealth of rural regions by comparing the
   inclusive wealth of Sado Island and Japan between 1990 and 2014. Minor
   methodological modifications were made according to data availability at
   the local level and to improve the accuracy of human capital
   estimations. Results captured the ongoing shrinkage of Sado and
   demonstrate the distinct potential of the IWI as a stock measure. Sado's
   per capita wealth was about 10\% lower than the national averages, but
   its natural capital was about threefold national averages. Supplementary
   estimations of the natural capital of fisheries and cultivated forests
   suggest that inclusion of additional factors in the evaluation would
   further increase the relative valuation of rural regions. We discuss
   implications of our estimations for wellbeing, and conclude with a
   critical appraisal of the IWI calculation towards policy implementation
   of the index.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the risk that self-reinforcing feedbacks could push the Earth
   System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent
   stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature rises and cause
   continued warming on a ``Hothouse Earth{''} pathway even as human
   emissions are reduced. Crossing the threshold would lead to a much
   higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2
   million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in
   the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist
   and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting
   trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems,
   society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the
   Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a
   habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of
   the entire Earth System-biosphere, climate, and societies-and could
   include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere
   carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new
   governance arrangements, and transformed social values.}},

   forest enterprises as hybrid business models. The second is the increase
   of studies examining how REDD+ can contribute to the goals of CFM, and
   vice versa. The key methodological trend is the use of secondary data
   sets to determine outcomes of CFM policies at regional and national

   effectiveness of CFM as a forest policy and institutional intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Transition' and `transformation' have become buzzwords in political and
   scientific discourses. They signal the need for large-scale changes to
   achieve a sustainable society. We compare how they are applied and
   interpreted in scientific literatures to explore whether they are
   distinct concepts and provide complementary insights. Transition and
   transformation are not mutually exclusive; they provide nuanced
   perspectives on how to describe, interpret and support desirable radical
   and non-linear societal change. Their differences may partially result
   from their etymological origins, but they largely stem from the
   different research communities concerned with either transition or
   transformation. Our review shows how the respective approaches and
   perspectives on understanding and interpreting system change can enrich
   each other.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH POLICY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{735-749}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow
   similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the
   relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly
   between different regions and countries. It takes a critical stance on
   the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies'
   socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative `global'
   regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor
   networks and institutional rationalities, which influence transition
   dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on
   globalization theories from sociology and human geography, we show that
   socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that
   are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in
   various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the
   multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in
   socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the
   conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this
   with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese
   wastewater sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on
   wastewater infrastructure expansion were not only influenced by
   path-dependencies stemming from China's national context, but equally
   (or even more critically) by the dominant rationality of the water
   sector's global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the
   contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global
   socio-technical regimes.}},

   review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{703-722}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Circular Economy (CE) aims to overcome the take-make-dispose linear
   pattern of production and consumption, proposing a circular system in
   which the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in
   the economy as long as possible. In recent years there has been a
   proliferation of scholars' publications on the topic. This study
   presents the results of a systematic literature review exploring the
   state-of-the-art of academic research on CE. The paper examines the CE
   body of literature with a systematic approach, to provide an exhaustive
   analysis of the phenomenon with rigorous and reproducible research
   criteria. The revisited material consists of 565 articles collected
   through the Web of Science and Scopus databases, and has been evaluated
   using specific structural dimensions to group literature into analytical
   categories. Starting from being a concept studied in connection with
   industrial ecology, CE has slowly acquired its independent role in
   academic research, framed mainly into environmental sustain ability
   related studies. As a result of policies implementation, academic
   production is mainly concentrated in China and Europe, employing tools
   and methods for modelling processes and supporting decision-making for
   CE implementation (e.g. Life Cycle Assessment and Material Flow
   Analysis). CE studies follow three main lines of action: the first aims
   to change the social and economic dynamics at macro and administrative
   level; the second to support firms in circular processes implementation
   at micro level to spread new forms of consumption and product design;
   the third, developed at meso level, discusses industrial symbiosis
   experiences. CE is associated with a variety of concepts, and waste
   management emerges as the most relevant sub-sector. CE is also strongly
   connected with the concept of sustainability, proposing ways to
   operationalize its implementation at the environmental and economic
   level, while scholars only marginally consider social and institutional
   implications. The most explored practices are those related to cleaner
   production, aiming at reducing environmental impact and waste production
   along the life cycle of a product, and optimizing the performance and
   efficiency of processes. Conversely, studies on CE may devote greater
   attention to strategies for social and institutional changes, able to
   transform the upstream process of production and consumption.
   Considering business model strategies, scholars mainly focus on studying
   closing material loops strategy, while slowing the loops, which requires
   a radical change of consumption and production patterns, is only
   marginally included with respect to CE implementation. This study's
   findings highlight CE as an evolving concept that still requires
   development to consolidate its definition, boundaries, principles and
   associated practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The term tipping point has experienced explosive popularity across
   multiple disciplines over the last decade. Research on social-ecological
   systems (SES) has contributed to the growth and diversity of the term's
   use. The diverse uses of the term obscure potential differences between
   tipping behavior in natural and social systems, and issues of causality
   across natural and social system components in SES. This paper aims to
   create the foundation for a discussion within the SES research community
   about the appropriate use of the term tipping point, especially the
   relatively novel term `social tipping point.' We review existing
   literature on tipping points and similar concepts (e.g. regime shifts,
   critical transitions) across all spheres of science published between
   1960 and 2016 with a special focus on a recent and still small body of
   work on social tipping points. We combine quantitative and qualitative
   analyses in a bibliometric approach, rooted in an expert elicitation
   process. We find that the term tipping point became popular after the
   year 2000-long after the terms regime shift and critical
   transition-across all spheres of science. We identify 23 distinct
   features of tipping point definitions and their prevalence across
   disciplines, but find no clear taxonomy of discipline-specific
   definitions. Building on the most frequently used features, we propose
   definitions for tipping points in general and social tipping points in
   SES in particular.}},

Abstract = {{The past decade has witnessed a resurgence in innovation awards, in
   particular of grand innovation prizes (GIPs) which are rewards to
   innovators developing technologies reaching performance goals and
   requiring breakthrough solutions. GIPs typically do not preclude the
   winner also obtaining patent rights. This is in stark contrast with
   mainstream economics of innovation theories where prizes and patents are
   substitute ways to generate revenue and encourage innovation. Building
   on the management of innovation literature which stresses the difficulty
   to specify ex-ante all the technical features of the winning
   technologies, we develop a model in which innovative effort is
   multi-dimensional and only a subset of innovation tasks can be measured
   and contracted upon. We show that in this environment patent rights and
   cash rewards are complements, and that GIPS are often preferable to
   patent races or prizes requiring technologies to be placed in the public
   domain. Moreover, our model uncovers a tendency for patent races to
   encourage speed of discovery over quality of innovation, which can be
   corrected by GIPs. We explore robustness to endogenous entry, costly
   public funds, and incomplete information by GIP organizers on the
   surplus created by the technology.}},

Title = {{Telecoupling: A new frontier for global sustainability}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Telecoupling refers to socioeconomic and environmental interactions
   between distant coupled human and natural systems, and has become more
   extensive and intensive in the globalized era. The integrated framework
   of telecoupling examines flows of information, energy, matter, people,
   organisms, and other things such as financial capital and goods and
   products around the globe. It pinpoints causes and effects arising from
   engagement of diverse agents in the global sphere. This first special
   feature on telecoupling includes 16 articles that explore diverse
   telecouplings including trade, migration, tourism, information exchange,
   and transnational product certification schemes. Here we synthesize the
   articles by describing eight overarching lessons learned. These include
   the impact of physical, social, and institutional distance on
   telecouplings, key roles of agents and their inter-relationships, and
   the important function of telecoupling in enhancing information signals
   over long distances. Several lessons directly apply to global
   sustainability challenges, such as the importance of recognizing
   trade-offs between local and global sustainability and the need for
   multi-level management and governance solutions. We also suggest five
   areas of future research to help propel this nascent field forward and
   further cement its applicability to addressing global sustainability
   challenges.}},

   principles for advancing research methods and approaches}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The study of social-ecological systems (SES) has been significantly
   shaped by insights from research on complex adaptive systems (CAS). We
   offer a brief overview of the conceptual integration of CAS research and
   its implications for the advancement of SES studies and methods. We
   propose a conceptual typology of six organizing principles of CAS based
   on a comparison of leading scholars' classifications of CAS features and
   properties. This typology clusters together similar underlying
   organizing principles of the features and attributes of CAS, and serves
   as a heuristic framework for identifying methods and approaches that
   account for the key features of SES. These principles can help identify
   appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three
   main implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there
   needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions
   in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that
   characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the
   intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences
   for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and
   studying SES interactions. Third, engagement with SES as CAS poses
   normative challenges for problem-oriented researchers and practitioners
   taking on real-world challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Social-ecological systems (SES) research offers new theory and evidence
   to transform sustainable development to better contend with the
   challenges of the Anthropocene. Four insights from contemporary SES
   literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c)
   systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored.
   Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are
   suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social
   and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential
   susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is
   highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities
   required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable
   development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and
   beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between
   social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to
   support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these
   perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel
   opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the
   Anthropocene.}},

Abstract = {{New partnerships between governments, private companies, and
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are reshaping global environmental

   sustainability standards in an attempt to manage social and
   environmental impacts of global supply chains. We analyze the large
   spectrum of interactions between private, public, and civil society
   actors around voluntary sustainability standards, primarily for tropical
   agriculture and forestry. This review uncovers a policy ecosystem
   dominated by a proliferation of standards that complement, substitute,
   or compete against each other, with coordination mechanisms beginning to
   arise. Contrary to widely held views, interactions between governments,
   NGOs, and private companies surrounding the adoption of sustainable
   practices are not generally antagonistic, and public and private
   environmental governance regimes rarely operate independently. The
   influence of these interactions on the effectiveness of sustainability
   standards needs more attention. Better understanding how private
   regulations interact with the policy ecosystem will help design more
   effective interventions.}},

   activities, including scenario development, quantitative modeling, and

   provide greater clarity on themany diverse approaches employed, and
   examine their use by decision makers in different fields and at
   different geographic, administrative, and temporal scales. Experience
   shows the importance of clearly formulated questions, structured dialog,
   carefully designed scenarios, sophisticated biophysical and
   socioeconomic analysis, and iteration as needed to more effectively link
   the growing scenarios and foresight community with today's decision
   makers and to better address the social, economic, and environmental
   challenges of tomorrow.}},

Title = {{The Regime Shifts Database: a framework for analyzing regime shifts in
   social-ecological systems}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes
   in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on
   ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the
   vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely
   unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different
   ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven.
   Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather
   than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for
   identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime
   shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an
   open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on
   social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a
   consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information
   resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching
   initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime
   shifts and > 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a
   literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying
   the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human
   well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime
   shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most
   prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and
   aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects
   of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an
   array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will
   stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform
   policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to
   manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.}},

Title = {{Reframing the sustainable development goals to achieve sustainable
   development in the Anthropocene-a systems approach}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Griggs et al. (2013) redefine sustainable development as ``development
   that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding Earth's
   life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future
   generations depend.{''} We recommend this as the end goal that the
   United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) should strive to
   achieve. Integration across the SDGs is less than what is required from
   a science perspective. Effective implementation of the SDGs will require
   States to attend to trade-offs and overlaps. We argue that continuous
   failure to address integration within the SDGs will jeopardize
   realization of this ultimate end goal. Therefore, we adopt a systems
   approach to identify gaps and connections across the goals and targets
   of the SDGs as well as leverage points for effective intervention. We
   triangulate across methods of critical analysis, conceptual modeling,
   and keyword network analysis to draw out seven ``overarching
   directions{''} that could provide a prioritization framework to enhance
   efficient implementation of the SDGs. Our results identify main gaps as
   exclusion of key actors (e.g., corporations) and issues (e.g.,
   intergenerational equity and population); inadequate reconciliation of
   economic growth with maintaining the Earth system; and deficient
   consideration of the relationship with international law. Conceptual
   mapping identifies education and innovation; governance and
   implementation; sustainable consumption and production; and addressing
   the key drivers of climate change as key leverage points. The keyword
   analysis highlights greater integration within the SDGs than what
   appears at face value. Keywords ``access,{''} ``women,{''}
   ``resources,{''}and ``finance{''} feature across the SDGs and provide
   further leverage points. Targeting these issues will facilitate
   realization of a high proportion of SDGs and correspondingly could have
   a disproportional impact on effective SDG implementation. We conclude
   that the success of the SDGs needs to be evaluated by the extent to
   which it contributes to human development while advancing protection of
   ``planetary must-haves{''} for current and future generations.}},

Abstract = {{Learning is considered as a promising mechanism to cope with rapid

   management (NRM) have not been explored in-depth and the evidence on the
   topic is scattered across multiple sources. We provide a qualitative
   review of types of learning outcomes and consider their manifestations
   in NRM across selected empirical literature. We conducted a systematic
   search of the peer-reviewed literature (N = 1,223) and a qualitative
   meta-synthesis of included articles, with an explicit focus on learning
   outcomes and NRM changes (N = 53). Besides social learning, we found
   several learning concepts used, including policy and transformative
   learning, and multiple links between learning and NRM reported. We
   observe that the development of skills, together with a system approach
   involving multi-level capacities, is decisive for implications of
   learning for NRM. Future reviews could systematically compare how
   primary research applies different learning concepts and discusses links
   between learning and NRM changes.}},

   mechanism through which they influence the legitimacy, expectations and
   field boundaries of the emerging technological fields. Our study draws
   attention to the fact that incumbents enter emerging fields at an

Abstract = {{Rising inequalities and accelerating global environmental change pose
   two of the most pressing challenges of the twenty-first century. To
   explore how these phenomena are linked, we apply a social-ecological
   systems perspective and review the literature to identify six different
   types of interactions (or ``pathways{''}) between inequality and the
   biosphere. We find that most of the research so far has only considered
   one-directional effects of inequality on the biosphere, or vice versa.
   However, given the potential for complex dynamics between socioeconomic
   and environmental factors within social-ecological systems, we highlight
   examples from the literature that illustrate the importance of
   cross-scale interactions and feedback loops between inequality and the
   biosphere. This review draws on diverse disciplines to advance a
   systemic understanding of the linkages between inequality and the
   biosphere, specifically recognizing cross-scale feedbacks and the
   multidimensional nature of inequality.}},

Abstract = {{Research on environmental change has often focused on changes in
   population as a significant driver of unsustainability and environmental
   degradation. Demographic pessimism and limited engagement with
   demographic realities underpin many arguments concerning limits to
   growth, environmental refugees, and environment-related conflicts.
   Re-engagement between demographic and environmental sciences has led to
   greater understanding of the interactions between the size, composition,
   and distribution of populations and exposure to environmental risks and
   contributions to environmental burdens. Wereview the results of this
   renewed and far more nuanced research frontier, focusing in particular
   on the way demographic trends affect exposure, sensitivity, and
   adaptation to environmental change. New research has explained how
   migration systems interact with environmental challenges in individual
   decisions and in globally aggregate flows. Here we integrate analysis on
   demographic and environmental risks that often share a root cause in
   limited social freedoms and opportunities. We argue for a capabilities
   approach to promoting sustainable solutions for a more mobile world.}},

Abstract = {{Classic arguments for decentralization, augmented by ideas about how
   participation empowers the poor, motivate the widely used approach in
   foreign aid called community-driven development (CDD). CDD devolves
   control over the selection, implementation, and financial management of
   public goods to communities. Until recently, policy enthusiasm has
   outstripped the evidence. I synthesize findings from randomized
   controlled trials and find that CDD effectively delivers public goods
   and modest economic returns at low cost in difficult environments. There
   is little evidence, however, that CDD transforms local decision making
   or empowers the poor in any enduring way. Part of this failure may be
   because some constraints believed to be important-like insufficient
   social capital-appear not to bind. Others, like exclusive local
   institutions, are a problem, although not one that CDD remedies. These
   results present a conundrum: How much participation is enough to
   safeguard the gains of such extreme decentralization while minimizing
   the opportunity costs imposed on poor people's time?}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in land system science and in institutional analysis
   provide complementary, but still largely disconnected perspectives on
   land use change, governance, and sustainability in social-ecological
   systems, which are interconnected across distance. In this paper we
   bring together the emerging concept of telecoupled land systems and the
   established concept of polycentric governance to support the analysis
   and the development of sustainable land governance in interconnected
   social-ecological systems. We operationalize the two concepts by
   analyzing networks of action situations in which interactions between
   proximate and distant actors as well as socioeconomic and ecological
   processes cause land use change and affect the sustainability of land
   systems. To illustrate this integrated approach empirically, we analyze
   a case of transnational biofuel investment in Sierra Leone. We identify
   the characteristics of, and activities in, networks of action situations
   that affect the sustainability of land systems related to this case.
   Integration of the two concepts of telecoupled land systems and
   polycentric governance enables analysts to identify interactions in
   polycentric governance systems (1) as drivers of telecoupled
   sustainability problems and (2) as transformative approaches to such
   problems. The method provides one way for linking place-based analysis
   of land change with process-based analysis of land governance.}},

Title = {{Adaptive pathways and coupled infrastructure: seven centuries of
   adaptation to water risk and the production of vulnerability in Mexico
   City}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Infrastructure development is central to the processes that abate and
   produce vulnerabilities in cities. Urban actors, especially those with
   power and authority, perceive and interpret vulnerability and decide
   when and how to adapt. When city managers use infrastructure to reduce
   urban risk in the complex, interconnected city system, new fragilities
   are introduced because of inherent system feedbacks. We trace the
   interactions between system dynamics and decision-making processes over
   700 years of Mexico City's adaptations to water risks, focusing on the
   decision cycles of public infrastructure providers (in this case,
   government authorities). We bring together two lenses in examining this
   history: robustness-vulnerability trade-offs to explain the evolution of
   systemic risk dynamics mediated by feedback control, and adaptation
   pathways to focus on the evolution of decision cycles that motivate
   significant infrastructure investments. Drawing from historical
   accounts, archeological evidence, and original research on water,
   engineering, and cultural history, we examine adaptation pathways of
   humans settlement, water supply, and flood risk. Mexico City's history
   reveals insights that expand the theory of coupled infrastructure and
   lessons salient to contemporary urban risk management: (1) adapting by
   spatially externalizing risks can backfire: as cities expand, such risks
   become endogenous; (2) over time, adaptation pathways initiated to
   address specific risks may begin to intersect, creating complex
   trade-offs in risk management; and (3) city authorities are agents of
   risk production: even in the face of new exogenous risks (climate
   change), acknowledging and managing risks produced endogenously may
   prove more adaptive. History demonstrates that the very best solutions
   today may present critical challenges for tomorrow, and that
   collectively people have far more agency in and influence over the
   complex systems we live in than is often acknowledged.}},

Abstract = {{Most societies are economically dominated by a small elite, and
   similarly, natural communities are typically dominated by a small
   fraction of the species. Here we reveal a strong similarity between
   patterns of inequality in nature and society, hinting at fundamental
   unifying mechanisms. We show that chance alone will drive 1\% or less of
   the community to dominate 50\% of all resources in situations where
   gains and losses are multiplicative, as in returns on assets or growth
   rates of populations. Key mechanisms that counteract such hyperdominance
   include natural enemies in nature and wealth-equalizing institutions in
   society. However, historical research of European developments over the
   past millennium suggests that such institutions become ineffective in
   times of societal upscaling. A corollary is that in a globalizing world,
   wealth will inevitably be appropriated by a very small fraction of the
   population unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions emerge at the
   global level.}},

Abstract = {{This paper conceptualizes power and empowerment in the context of
   sustainability transitions and transition governance. The field of
   transition studies has been critically interrogated for undermining the
   role of power, which has inspired various endeavours to theorize power
   and agency in transitions. This paper presents the POwer-IN-Transition
   framework (POINT), which is developed as a conceptual framework to
   analyse power and (dis)empowerment in transformative social change,
   integrating transition concepts and multiple power and empowerment
   theories. The first section introduces transitions studies and discusses
   its state-of-the-art regarding power. This is followed by a typology of
   power relations and different types of power (reinforcive, innovative,
   transformative). These notions are then used to reframe transition
   concepts, in particular the multi-level perspective, in terms of power
   dynamics. The critical challenges of (dis)empowerment and unintended
   power implications of discourses on and policies for sustainability
   transitions' are discussed. The paper concludes with a synthesis of the
   arguments and challenges for future research. Copyright (c) 2017 John

Title = {{40 years of global environmental assessments: A retrospective analysis}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{193-202}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides a retrospective analysis of global environmental
   assessment (GEA) processes and their changing character, focus and
   political context over the past 40 years. We examine how and why
   elements of organizational design, objectives, and the evolving
   political landscape have interacted and changed, with a view of
   informing the design and conduct of future processes. We find that the
   historical genesis of GEAs is closely connected to the emergence of
   environmental multilateralism. However, the prevailing conditions and
   assumptions which originally gave rise to the GEA concept have changed
   significantly over time, giving rise to an increasing demand for a focus
   on response options and policies. We also find that the epistemic and
   process complexity of GEAs has increased substantially, without a
   corresponding expansion in the magnitude and composition of GEA
   management teams. We suggest that developing analytical capacities for
   policy assessment as well as ensuring sufficient resources and tools to
   manage increasingly complex GEAs is essential to ensure their future
   relevance and success. This article is part of a special issue on
   solution-oriented GEAs.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Energy transitions face multiple barriers, lock-in, path dependencies
   and resistance to change which require strategic policy efforts to be
   overcome. In this regard, it has been increasingly recognised that a
   multiplicity of instruments - or instrument mixes - are needed to foster
   low-carbon transitions. In addition, over the past few years a broader
   conceptualization of policy mixes for sustainability transitions has
   emerged which we adopt in this special issue. Such a broader perspective
   not only examines the interaction of instruments, but also captures
   corresponding policy strategies with their long-term targets and pays
   greater attention to the associated policy processes. It also
   encompasses the analysis of overarching policy mix characteristics such
   as consistency, coherence or credibility, as well as policy design
   considerations. Furthermore, it embraces the analysis of actors and
   institutions involved in developing and implementing such policy mixes.
   To explicitly consider these further aspects of policy mixes, this
   special issue includes fifteen papers with different analytical
   perspectives drawing on a range of social science disciplines, such as
   environmental economics, innovation studies and policy sciences. It is
   our hope that the conceptual and empirical advances presented here will
   stimulate diverse future research and inform policy advice on policy
   mixes for energy transitions.}},

Title = {{Social learning for resilience in social-ecological systems}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{100-107}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fostering of social learning is generally considered an important
   governance instrument to build resilience in social-ecological systems.
   Empirical studies addressing the contribution of social learning to
   resilience are scarce however, and do not provide direct evidence but
   infer this contribution from the impacts of social learning on system
   governance and management. These impacts are found more frequently at
   the local level than at higher, regional or national levels, probably
   depending on the overlap between participants in social learning and
   actors in governance and management. Recent studies have shown that at
   higher levels a connection between social learning and policy can be
   achieved through bridging actors or organizations, and vertical linkages
   between governance levels. Conceptually and methodologically the study
   of social learning and its relation with resilience has advanced
   sufficiently to enable more rigorous and detailed empirical research.
   This should focus on how attempts to foster social learning within
   social-ecological governance systems can be made more effective and
   efficient, for example, through the use of new technologies to support
   the learning process or through the creation of permanent, informal
   multistakeholder learning spaces within formal policy structures.}},

Abstract = {{To date, the field of transition research lacks a suitable vocabulary to
   analyse the (changing) interactions and relations of actors as part of a

   research to allow the analysis of (changing) roles and relations between
   actor roles as indicative of changes in the social fabric and shared
   values, norms and beliefs. It also allows considering the use of roles
   as a transition governance intervention. This includes creating new
   roles, breaking down or altering existing ones and explicitly
   negotiating or purposefully assigning roles, as well as the flexible use

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework for the analysis of technological

   innovation system concepts and recent elaborations on the globalization
   of innovation, we develop a multi-scalar conceptualization of innovation
   systems. Two key mechanisms are introduced and elaborated: the
   generation of resources in multi-locational subsystems and the
   establishment of structural couplings among them in a global innovation
   system (GIS). Based on this conceptualization, we introduce a typology
   of four generic GIS configurations, building on the innovation mode and
   valuation system in different industry types. The analytical framework
   is illustrated with insights from four emerging clean-tech industries.
   We state that a comprehensive GIS perspective is instrumental for
   developing a more explanatory stance in the innovation system literature
   and developing policy interventions that reflect the increasing spatial
   complexity in the innovation process.}},

Title = {{Bridging the energy divide and securing higher collective well-being in
   a climate-constrained world}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{435-450}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Despite the impressive gains in available energy over the last 200
   years, the associated benefits remain unevenly distributed. Bridging
   this divide only adds to the already daunting challenge of securing
   climate stabilization. In fact, efforts towards the former are more
   likely to conflict with the latter. To be able to address this dilemma,
   the relationship between energy consumption and human well-being, beyond
   its economic dimension, needs to be better understood. This paper aims
   to contribute to the emerging knowledge base, by examining this
   relationship using a proxy for human well-being that also considers its
   environmental and social dimensions. The ultimate goal of this paper is
   to investigate the potential incompatibility between efforts towards the
   achievement of higher collective well-being and those associated with
   climate stabilization. To this end, it provides estimates of the
   additional energy needed and its associated carbon emissions under
   different climate scenarios, and compares them with existing carbon
   budgets. Results indicate that even if new climate policies were
   adopted, emissions associated with higher well-being in all regions
   where improvements are needed could still reach up to one and a half
   times estimated 2 degrees C budgets, and even more so for lower
   temperature increase targets.}},

Abstract = {{The ocean represents a fundamental source of micronutrients and protein
   for a growing world population. Seafood is a highly traded and sought
   after commodity on international markets, and is critically dependent on
   healthy marine ecosystems. A global trend of wild stocks being
   overfished and in decline, as well as multiple sustainability challenges
   associated with a rapid growth of aquaculture, represent key concerns in
   relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Existing
   efforts aimed to improve the sustainability of seafood production have
   generated important progress, primarily at the local and national
   levels, but have yet to effectively address the global challenges
   associated with the ocean. This study highlights the importance of
   transnational corporations in enabling transformative change, and
   thereby contributes to advancing the limited understanding of
   large-scale private actors within the sustainability science literature.
   We describe how we engaged with large seafood producers to coproduce a
   global science-business initiative for ocean stewardship. We suggest
   that this initiative is improving the prospects for transformative
   change by providing novel links between science and business, between
   wild-capture fisheries and aquaculture, and across geographical space.
   We argue that scientists can play an important role in facilitating
   change by connecting knowledge to action among global actors, while
   recognizing risks associated with such engagement. The methods developed
   through this case study contribute to identifying key competences in
   sustainability science and hold promises for other sectors as well.}},

Abstract = {{Networks with a modular structure are expected to have a lower risk of
   global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested
   until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test
   the effect of modularity on the response to perturbation. We perturbed
   one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this
   perturbation, both within and between modules. Our results show the
   buffering capacity of modular networks. To assess the generality of our
   findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that
   in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated
   with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local perturbation
   occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that
   protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.}},

Abstract = {{Nature is perceived and valued in starkly different and often
   conflicting ways. This paper presents the rationale for the inclusive
   valuation of nature's contributions to people (NCP) in decision making,
   as well as broad methodological steps for doing so. While developed
   within the context of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and
   Ecosystem Services (IPBES), this approach is more widely applicable to
   initiatives at the knowledge-policy interface, which require a
   pluralistic approach to recognizing the diversity of values. We argue
   that transformative practices aiming at sustainable futures would
   benefit from embracing such diversity, which require recognizing and
   addressing power relationships across stakeholder groups that hold
   different values on human naturerelations and NCP.}},

   only snapshot analyses of the initial design or the emergent structure
   of polycentric regimes. There is less systematic analysis of the
   longitudinal robustness of polycentric regimes. The problem of
   robustness is approached by focusing not only on the structure of a
   regime but also on its context and effectiveness. These dimensions are
   examined through a longitudinal analysis of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
   governance regime, drawing on in-depth interviews and demographic,
   economic, and employment data, as well as organizational records and
   participant observation. Between 1975 and 2011, the GBR regime evolved
   into a robust polycentric structure as evident in an established set of
   multiactor, multilevel arrangements addressing marine, terrestrial, and
   global threats. However, from 2005 onward, multiscale drivers
   precipitated at least 10 types of regime change, ranging from contextual
   change that encouraged regime drift to deliberate changes that
   threatened regime conversion. More recently, regime realignment also has
   occurred in response to steering by international organizations and
   shocks such as the 2016 mass coral-bleaching event. The results show
   that structural density and stability in a governance regime can coexist
   with major changes in that regime's context and effectiveness. Clear
   analysis of the vulnerability of polycentric governance to both
   diminishing effectiveness and the masking effects of increasing
   complexity provides sustainability science and governance actors with a
   stronger basis to understand and respond to regime change.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of resilience is used by many in different ways: as a
   scientific concept, as a guiding principle, as inspirational `buzzword',
   or as a means to become more sustainable. Next to the academic debate on
   meaning and notions of resilience, the concept has been widely adopted
   and interpreted in policy contexts, particularly related to climate
   change and extreme weather events. In addition to having a positive
   connotation, resilience may cover aspects that are missed in common
   disaster risk Management approaches. Although the precise definition of
   resilience may remain subject of discussion, the views on what is
   important to consider in the management of extreme weather events do not
   differ significantly. Therefore, this paper identifies the key
   implications of resilience thinking for the management of extreme
   weather events and translates these into five practical principles for
   policy making. (C)2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   perspectives for inclusive development}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{7-13}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sociotechnical systems - for example, telecommunication networks,
   electric grids, large-scale manufacturing systems - are interacting
   ensembles of engineered artifacts embedded in society, linked with
   economies, and connected with ecology. Such systems have been analyzed
   through the lenses of sustainability (largely along the dimensions of
   environmental protection and affordability), carrying influence in the
   literatures of technology innovation, product design, infrastructure
   planning, and service delivery. Sustainability concerns along the
   environmental and financial dimensions have motivated focus on waste and
   emissions reduction, new technology development, and greening of
   industrial ecosystems. The concept of inclusive development, however,
   has not yet permeated the research or conceptualization of
   sociotechnical systems. Two streams of on-going work in inclusive
   innovation and in inclusive wealth analysis offer meaningful avenues for
   future connections. We discuss how the literature on sociotechnical
   systems and their constituent elements of engineered products and
   processes has evolved on the topic of sustainability, how the emerging
   concept of inclusive innovation bridges dimensions of environment and
   social inclusivity, and how inclusive wealth may inform system-level
   planning and analysis of sociotechnical systems moving forward.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Research summary: This article provides a review of real options theory
   (ROT) in strategic management research. We review the fundamentals of
   ROT and provide a taxonomy of this research. By synthesizing and
   critiquing research on real options, we identify a number of important
   challenges as well as opportunities for ROT if it is to enhance its
   impact on strategic management and potentially develop into a
   theoretical pillar in the field. We examine how ROT can inform the key
   tensions that managers face between commitment versus flexibility as
   well as between competition versus cooperation, and we show how it can
   uniquely address the fundamental issues in strategy. We conclude with
   suggestions on future research directions that could enhance and unify
   the thus-far distinct main approaches to real options research.
   Managerial summary: Real options theory (ROT) applies the heuristics and
   valuation models originally designed for financial securities to the
   domain of corporate investment decisions (e. g., joint ventures {[}
   JVs], foreign direct investment, research and development {[} R\& D],
   etc.) and strategic decision making under uncertainty. This article
   provides a synthesis of this body of research in strategic management
   and related disciplines. We suggest how ROT can address fundamental
   issues of strategy, including the dilemmas managers face between
   commitment versus flexibility as well as between competition versus
   cooperation. We discuss how three distinct approaches to real options
   analysis can complement each other, and we identify some of the main
   challenges and opportunities for ROT to become a theoretical pillar in
   strategy. Copyright c 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{939-978}},
Abstract = {{Complexity economics has quickly become a powerful research program for
   real-world economics in recent years. This article provides an overview
   of complexity economics, and argues that it is incompatible with the
   ``equilibrium{''} and ``optimality{''} conceptions of the mainstream and
   its ``market economy.{''} Instead, it develops older heterodox -
   including evolutionary-institutional - issues like self-organization,
   emergence, path-dependence, idiosyncrasies, lock-ins, or skewed power
   distributions. Also, the space for emergent institutions through the
   ``intentionality{''} of agents, including their improving collective
   performance, reducing complexity, and others, is investigated. This
   article considers complex adaptive systems through ``games on
   networks{''} in an ``evolution-of-cooperation{''} perspective. Moreover,
   a surge in policy implications of economic complexity has emerged, even
   if still rather general. With some more specific implications derived,
   the article again reveals the close similarities with long-standing
   heterodoxies: namely, pragmatist policy conceptions in this respect.}},

Abstract = {{Human actions are transforming ecosystems across the globe. Six
   frameworks aid in understanding the forces that drive human stress on
   the environment and human responses to this stress. Two of them, the
   stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology

   data. Four describe the interrelated system of human actions and
   environmental responses: driving forces, pressures, states, impacts,
   responses (DPSIR); the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework;
   coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and telecoupling; and
   social-ecological systems (SES). In applying these frameworks, attention
   must be given to the scale of analysis and to the effects of context. In
   addition to the frameworks there are four substantial research
   literatures providing theory and empirical analysis of how drivers place
   stress on the environment: a macrocomparative tradition, work on
   household energy consumption, land change science, and research on
   commons. Although these traditions remain somewhat separate, they are

Abstract = {{Clouded titles to land in remote rural areas of the Global South have
   recently prevented increases in agricultural productivity and payments
   for environmental services (PES), so making land tenure more secure has
   become a priority for policymakers. The historical dynamics surrounding
   land tenure transitions suggest a strategy for reform. Colonial regimes
   stripped indigenous peoples of most rights to land. Newly independent
   states restored these rights for some smallholders through land reforms.
   Later, neo-liberal regimes made secure titles more expensive, and, in so
   doing, made insecure land tenure more pervasive. Spots of secure land
   tenure did emerge when indigenous groups, with outside support, resisted
   efforts by powerful outsiders to expropriate indigenous homelands.
   Because insecure land tenure persists in most forested rural areas, a
   focus on afforestation in deforested areas, where earlier episodes of
   reform secured smallholder land tenure, offers a promising direction for
   future PES and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
   Degradation) efforts.}},

   judgment to evidence and its uncertainties, (c) exploring widely ranging
   futures and their connections to ongoing choices and actions, and (d)
   incorporating interactions among experts and decision makers in
   assessment processes. Across these assessment priorities, we survey past
   experiences, current practices, and possibilities for future
   experimentation, innovation, and learning. In our current era of climate
   and broader global change, integrative assessment can bolster decisions
   about contested and uncertain futures. We consider both opportunities

Abstract = {{The article describes the field of sustainability transitions research,
   which emerged in the past two decades in the context of a growing
   scientific and public interest in large-scale societal transformation
   toward sustainability. We describe how different scientific approaches
   and methodological positions explore diverse types of transitions and
   provide the basis for multiple theories and models for governance of
   sustainability transitions. We distinguish three perspectives in
   studying transitions: socio-technical, socio-institutional, and
   socio-ecological. Although the field as a whole is very heterogeneous,
   commonalities can be characterized in notions such as path dependencies,
   regimes, niches, experiments, and governance. These more generic
   concepts have been adopted within the analytical perspective of
   transitions, which has led three different types of approaches to
   dealing with agency in transitions: analytical, evaluative, and
   experimental. The field has by now produced a broad theoretical and
   empirical basis along with a variety of social transformation strategies
   and instruments, impacting disciplinary scientific fields as well as
   (policy) practice. In this article, we try to characterize the field by
   identifying its main perspectives, approaches and shared concepts, and
   its relevance to real-world sustainability problems and solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of research across several disciplines have produced substantial
   evidence that labor unions, on balance, reduce economic disparities. But
   unions are complicated, multifaceted organizations straddling markets
   and politics. Much of their equality-promoting influence occurs through
   their ability to reduce class-based inequity in politics and public
   policy. Declining unionization across much of the developed world is
   eroding workers' bargaining power. Reduced economic leverage puts
   pressure on union solidarity and weakens labor-based political
   movements. Important research design problems and significant
   heterogeneity across unions, regions, countries, and time imply a
   continued need for more work.}},

Abstract = {{What do we know about wealth inequality and democracy? Our review shows
   that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and
   that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by
   the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality
   sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make
   this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other
   than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing
   policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth
   depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures,
   and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair.
   Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic
   process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when,
   where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is
   less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful
   avenue for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods
   and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using
   the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges:
   overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite
   gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and
   partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity
   conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring
   them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex
   adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the
   interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how
   policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the
   behavior of different system components is critical for building robust,
   sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review
   reveals that altering incentives-either economic or social norms, or
   both-can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of
   well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem
   service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and
   economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that
   incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb
   illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance
   reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between
   individual actors and emergent system properties were altered,
   triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest
   that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives
   of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach
   that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In
   short, getting incentives right matters.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{329-339}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Hunter Valley, in New South Wales, Australia, is a globally
   significant coal mining and exporting region. The Hunter economy's
   strong basis in fossil fuel production and consumption is challenged by
   civil society campaigns employing environmental justice discourses. This
   paper analyses how two civil society campaigns in the Hunter region
   ('Stop T4' and `Groundswell') have countered the regional hegemony of
   fossil fuel interests from an environmental justice perspective.
   However, the discursive dominance of the jobs versus environment' frame
   hinders efforts to build solidarity amongst local environmental justice
   goals on the one hand, and workers and union aspirations for secure,
   quality jobs on the other. Long-term structural decline of global coal
   markets adds pressure for economic transition. We argue that campaigns
   to open up possibilities for transition away from fossil fuel dependency
   to a post carbon society can be strengthened by engaging with the `just
   transition' discourses that are typically associated with organised
   labour. Doing so can create synergy for social change by aligning
   community and labour movement interests. Inclusive social movement
   partnerships around this synergy must address structural disadvantage
   that creates social and economic insecurity if communities are to
   prevail over the fossil fuel sector's hegemony. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents insights and action proposals to better harness
   technological innovation for sustainable development. We begin with
   three key insights from scholarship and practice. First, technological
   innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from
   complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions
   operating simultaneously from local to global scales. Barriers arise at
   all stages of innovation, from the invention of a technology through its
   selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Second,
   learning from past efforts to mobilize innovation for sustainable
   development can be greatly improved through structured cross-sectoral
   comparisons that recognize the socio-technical nature of innovation
   systems. Third, current institutions (rules, norms, and incentives)
   shaping technological innovation are often not aligned toward the goals
   of sustainable development because impoverished, marginalized, and
   unborn populations too often lack the economic and political power to
   shape innovation systems to meet their needs. However, these
   institutions can be reformed, and many actors have the power to do so
   through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and
   financing. We conclude with three practiceoriented recommendations to
   further realize the potential of innovation for sustainable development:
   (i) channels for regularized learning across domains of practice should
   be established; (ii) measures that systematically take into account the
   interests of underserved populations throughout the innovation process
   should be developed; and (iii) institutions should be reformed to
   reorient innovation systems toward sustainable development and ensure
   that all innovation stages and scales are considered at the outset.}},

Abstract = {{This paper distills core lessons about how researchers (scientists,
   engineers, planners, etc.) interested in promoting sustainable
   development can increase the likelihood of producing usable knowledge.
   We draw the lessons from both practical experience in diverse contexts
   around the world and from scholarly advances in understanding the
   relationships between science and society. Many of these lessons will be
   familiar to those with experience in crafting knowledge to support
   action for sustainable development. However, few are included in the
   formal training of researchers. As a result, when scientists and
   engineers first venture out of the laboratory or library with the goal
   of linking their knowledge with action, the outcome has often been
   ineffectiveness and disillusionment. We therefore articulate here a core
   set of lessons that we believe should become part of the basic training
   for researchers interested in crafting usable knowledge for sustainable
   development. These lessons entail at least four things researchers
   should know, and four things they should do. The knowing lessons involve
   understanding the coproduction relationships through which knowledge
   making and decision making shape one another in social-environmental
   systems. We highlight the lessons that emerge from examining those
   coproduction relationships through the ICAP lens, viewing them from the
   perspectives of Innovation systems, Complex systems, Adaptive systems,
   and Political systems. The doing lessons involve improving the capacity
   of the research community to put its understanding of coproduction into
   practice. We highlight steps through which researchers can help build
   capacities for stakeholder collaboration, social learning, knowledge
   governance, and researcher training.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on the determinants of effectiveness in knowledge
   systems seeking to support sustainable development has highlighted the
   importance of ``boundary work{''} through which research communities
   organize their relations with new science, other sources of knowledge,
   and the worlds of action and policy-making. A growing body of
   scholarship postulates specific attributes of boundary work that promote
   used and useful research. These propositions, however, are largely based
   on the experience of a few industrialized countries. We report here on
   an effort to evaluate their relevance for efforts to harness science in
   support of sustainability in the developing world. We carried out a
   multicountry comparative analysis of natural resource management
   programs conducted under the auspices of the Consultative Group on
   International Agricultural Research. We discovered six distinctive kinds
   of boundary work contributing to the successes of those programs-a
   greater variety than has been documented in previous studies. We argue
   that these different kinds of boundary work can be understood as a dual
   response to the different uses for which the results of specific
   research programs are intended, and the different sources of knowledge
   drawn on by those programs. We show that these distinctive kinds of
   boundary work require distinctive strategies to organize them
   effectively. Especially important are arrangements regarding
   participation of stakeholders, accountability in governance, and the use
   of ``boundary objects.{''} We conclude that improving the ability of
   research programs to produce useful knowledge for sustainable
   development will require both greater and differentiated support for
   multiple forms of boundary work.}},

Abstract = {{The call for integrated social-environmental science, complete with
   outreach to applications and solutions, is escalating worldwide. Drawing
   on several decades of experience, researchers engaged in such science,
   completed an assessment of the design and management attributes and

   understand key impediments to success. These characteristics are
   delineated and discussed using examples from individual projects and
   programs. From this, three principal lessons leading to successful
   efforts emerge that address co-design, adaptive or flexible management,
   and diversity of knowledge. In addition, five challenges for this
   science are identified: accounting for change, addressing sponsorship
   and timelines, appreciating different knowledge systems, adaptively
   communicating, and improving linkages to policy.}},

Abstract = {{Global markets for agricultural products, timber, and minerals are
   critically important drivers of deforestation. The supply chains driving
   land use change may also provide opportunities to halt deforestation.
   Market campaigns, moratoria, and certification schemes have been
   promoted as powerful tools to achieve conservation goals. Despite their
   promise, there have been few opportunities to rigorously quantify the
   ability of these nonstate, market-driven (NSMD) governance regimes to
   deliver conservation outcomes. This study analyzes the impacts of three
   NSMD governance systems that sought to end the conversion of natural
   forests to plantations in Chile at the start of the 21st century. Using
   a multilevel, panel dataset of land use changes in Chile, we identify
   the impact of participation within each of the governance regimes by
   implementing a series of matched difference-in-differences analyses.
   Taking advantage of the mosaic of different NSMD regimes adopted in
   Chile, we explore the relative effectiveness of different policies. NSMD
   governance regimes reduced deforestation on participating properties by
   2-23\%. The NSMD governance regimes we studied included collaborative
   and confrontational strategies between environmental and industry
   stakeholders. We find that the more collaborative governance systems
   studied achieved better environmental performance than more
   confrontational approaches. Whereas many government conservation
   programs have targeted regions with little likelihood of conversion, we
   demonstrate that NSMD governance has the potential to alter behavior on
   high-deforestation properties.}},

Abstract = {{Under increased pressure to report environmental impacts, some firms
   selectively disclose relatively benign impacts, creating an impression
   of transparency while masking their true performance. We theorize
   circumstances under which firms are less likely to engage in such
   selective disclosure, focusing on organizational and institutional
   factors that intensify scrutiny and expectations of transparency and
   that foster civil society mobilization. We test our hypotheses using a
   novel panel data set of 4,750 public companies across many industries
   that are headquartered in 45 countries during 2004-2007. Results show
   that firms that are more environmentally damaging, particularly those in
   countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and global norms, are
   less likely to engage in selective disclosure. We discuss contributions

Abstract = {{This perspective discusses nine conditions for enhancing the performance
   of multistakeholder partnerships for sustainable development. Such
   partnerships have become mainstream implementation mechanisms for
   attaining international sustainable development goals and are also
   frequently used in other adjacent policy domains such as climate change,
   health and biodiversity. While multistakeholder arrangements are widely
   perceived as a positive contribution to addressing global change, few
   studies have systematically evaluated the existing evidence for their
   positive performance. This poses an urgent and important challenge for
   researchers and practitioners to understand and improve the
   effectiveness of partnerships, in particular since their popularity
   increases despite their past track record. The recommendations presented
   are based on own research, a literature survey and discussions with a
   large number or international Civil Society Organizations at two
   occasions during 2014. This article proceeds as follows: first, we
   define multistakeholder partnerships, outline their rational and
   summarize available assessments on partnership success; second, we
   provide a set of concrete recommendations based on lessons-learned from
   over 10 years of scholarship; and third, we conclude with some

   theories, scholars, case examples, debates, methods, and (multiple)
   interpretations of environmental justice (EJ), as well as its expansion
   and globalization. We then look to some newly emerging themes, actions,
   and strategies for EJ and just sustainabilities. First, we look at the
   practices and materials of everyday life, illustrated by food and energy
   movements; second, the ongoing work on community and the importance of
   identity and attachment, informed by urban planning, food, and climate
   concerns; third, the growing interest in the relationship between human
   practices and communities and nonhuman nature. We also expand on the
   longstanding interest in just sustainabilities within this movement,
   illustrated by a wide range of concerns with food, energy, and climate
   justice. These new areas of work illustrate both recent developments and
   a set of paths forward for both the theory and practice of EJ.}},

Abstract = {{Existing technologies, institutions, and behavioral norms together act
   to constrain the rate and magnitude of carbon emissions reductions in
   the coming decades. The inertia of carbon emissions due to such mutually
   reinforcing physical, economic, and social constraints is referred to as
   carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in is a special case of path dependency,
   which is common in the evolution of complex systems. However, carbon
   lock-in is particularly prone to entrenchment given the large capital
   costs, long infrastructure lifetimes, and interrelationships between the
   socioeconomic and technical systems involved. Further, the urgency of
   efforts to avoid dangerous climate change exacerbates the liability of
   even small lock-in risks. Although carbon lock-in has been recognized
   for years, efforts to characterize the types and causes of carbon
   lock-in, or to quantitatively assess and evaluate its policy
   implications, have been limited and scattered across a number of
   different disciplines. This systematic review of the literature
   synthesizes what is known about the types and causes of carbon lock-in,
   including the scale, magnitude, and longevity of the effects, and policy
   implications. We identify three main types of carbon lock-in and
   describe how they coevolve: (a) infrastructural and technological, (b)
   institutional, and (c) behavioral. Although each type of lock-in has its
   own set of processes, all three are tightly intertwined and contribute
   to the inertia of carbon emissions. We outline the conditions,
   opportunities, and strategies for fostering transitions toward
   less-carbon-intensive emissions trajectories. We conclude by proposing a
   carbon lock-in research agenda that can help bridge the gaps between
   science, knowledge, and policy-making.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience thinking in relation to the environment has emerged as a lens
   of inquiry that serves a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue and
   collaboration. Resilience is about cultivating the capacity to sustain
   development in the face of expected and surprising change and diverse
   pathways of development and potential thresholds between them. The
   evolution of resilience thinking is coupled to social-ecological systems
   and a truly intertwined human-environment planet. Resilience as
   persistence, adaptability, and transformability of complex adaptive
   social-ecological systems is the focus, clarifying the dynamic and
   forward-looking nature of the concept. Resilience thinking emphasizes
   that social-ecological systems, from the individual, to community, to
   society as a whole, are embedded in the biosphere. The biosphere
   connection is an essential observation if sustainability is to be taken
   seriously. In the continuous advancement of resilience thinking there
   are efforts aimed at capturing resilience of social-ecological systems
   and finding ways for people and institutions to govern social-ecological
   dynamics for improved human well-being, at the local, across levels and
   scales, to the global. Consequently, in resilience thinking, development
   issues for human well-being, for people and planet, are framed in a
   context of understanding and governing complex social-ecological
   dynamics for sustainability as part of a dynamic biosphere.}},

Abstract = {{This review examines the relationships between politics, sustainability,
   and development. Following an overview of sustainability thinking across
   different traditions, the politics of resources and the influence of
   scarcity narratives on research, policy and practice are explored. This
   highlights the politics of transformations and the way these play out
   under combinations of technology-led, market-led, state-led, and
   citizen-led processes. In particular, this review points to the politics
   of alliance building and collective action for sustainability and
   development. Transformations cannot be managed or controlled, but must
   draw on an unruly politics, involving diverse knowledges and multiple
   actors. This review highlights how politics are articulated through
   regimes of truth, rule, and accumulation, and how understanding such
   political processes has implications for institutional and governance
   responses. The conclusion reflects on future research priorities and the
   methodological stance required for an effective response to the
   political challenges of sustainability and development.}},

Abstract = {{Growing concerns over climate change and the potential for large damages
   due to nonlinear processes underscore the need for a meaningful
   sustainability assessment of an economy. Economists have developed
   rigorous approaches to conceptualizing sustainability based on the
   paradigm of weak sustainability, which relies on extensive substitution
   among reproducible capital, renewable resources, and exhaustible natural
   resources. In contrast, strong sustainability emphasizes physical limits
   to this substitution and the importance of maintaining the resilience of
   normally functioning biophysical processes. Recent progress in resource
   and environmental economics has demonstrated the feasibility of
   incorporating strong sustainability features, including tipping points,
   uncertainties, and resilience, to assess efficiency and optimal
   policies. Given that weak sustainability and intertemporal efficiency
   share a welfare theoretic foundation, we ask: To what extent can these
   approaches be applied to evaluate sustainability? We highlight recent
   work on assessing sustainability in imperfect economies and dynamic
   models of intertemporal welfare that embed strong sustainability
   features.}},

Abstract = {{Variable flows of food, water, or other ecosystem services complicate
   planning. Management strategies that decrease variability and increase
   predictability may therefore be preferred. However, actions to decrease
   variance over short timescales (2-4 y), when applied continuously, may
   lead to long-term ecosystem changes with adverse consequences. We
   investigated the effects of managing short-term variance in three
   well-understood models of ecosystem services: lake eutrophication,
   harvest of a wild population, and yield of domestic herbivores on a
   rangeland. In all cases, actions to decrease variance can increase the
   risk of crossing critical ecosystem thresholds, resulting in less
   desirable ecosystem states. Managing to decrease short-term variance
   creates ecosystem fragility by changing the boundaries of safe operating
   spaces, suppressing information needed for adaptive management,
   cancelling signals of declining resilience, and removing pressures that
   may build tolerance of stress. Thus, the management of variance
   interacts strongly and inseparably with the management of resilience. By
   allowing for variation, learning, and flexibility while observing
   change, managers can detect opportunities and problems as they develop
   while sustaining the capacity to deal with them.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{523-533}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by a concern that adaptation and vulnerability
   research suffer from an under-theorization of the political mechanisms
   of social change and the processes that serve to reproduce vulnerability
   over time and space. We argue that adaptation is a socio-political
   process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple
   and concurrent environmental and social changes. We propose that
   applying concepts of subjectivity, knowledges and authority to the
   analysis of adaptation focuses attention on this socio-political
   process. Drawing from vulnerability, adaptation, political ecology and
   social theory literatures, we explain how power is reproduced or
   contested in adaptation practice through these three concepts. We assert
   that climate change adaptation processes have the potential to
   constitute as well as contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge,
   thereby opening up or closing down space for transformational
   adaptation. We expand on this assertion through four key propositions
   about how adaptation processes can be understood and outline an emergent
   empirical research agenda, which aims to explicitly examine these
   propositions in specific social and environmental contexts. We describe
   how the articles in this special issue are contributing to this nascent
   research agenda, providing an empirical basis from which to theorize the
   politics of adaptation. The final section concludes by describing the
   need for a reframing of adaptation policy, practice and analysis to
   engage with multiple adaptation knowledges, to question subjectivities
   inherent in discourses and problem understandings, and to identify how
   emancipatory subjectivities - and thus the potential for
   transformational adaptation - can be supported. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A critical appraisal of Sustainable Consumption and Production research:
   The reformist, revolutionary and reconfiguration positions}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{This conceptual review article provides a critical appraisal of
   Sustainable Consumption and Production research, which is currently
   framed by two generic positions. First, the `reformist' position, which
   focuses on firms pursuing green eco-innovations and consumers buying
   eco-efficient products, represents the political and academic orthodoxy.
   Second, the `revolutionary' position, which is a radical critique of the
   mainstream, advocates the abolishment of capitalism, materialism, and
   consumerism, and promotes values such as frugality, sufficiency, and
   localism. We find this dichotomous debate problematic, because it is
   intellectually stifling and politically conservative (in its outcomes).
   To move beyond this dichotomy, we propose a third position,
   `reconfiguration', which focuses on transitions in socio-technical
   systems and daily life practices and accommodates new conceptual
   frameworks. For each of the three positions, we discuss: (1) the scale
   and type of change, (2) views on consumption and production in exemplary
   approaches, (3) underlying theoretical, epistemological and normative
   orientations, (4) policy implications, and (5) critical appraisal. The
   conclusion compares the three positions, provides arguments for the
   fruitfulness of the reconfiguration-position and offers four critical
   reflections about future Sustainable Consumption and Production research
   agendas. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on sustainable development is a
   central element in the emerging governance architecture for sustainable
   development. Established at the 2012 United Nations (UN) Conference on
   Sustainable Development, the HLPF has a dauntingly expansive mandate -
   including setting the sustainable development agenda; enhancing
   integration, coordination and coherence across the UN system; and
   following up all sustainable development goals and commitments. Yet it
   has been granted limited authority and few material resources. In these
   circumstances, the HLPF must rely on the governance strategy of
   `orchestration': working indirectly through intermediary organizations,
   and using soft modes of influence to support and guide their actions.
   The forum's design suggests that states intended it to pursue this
   approach. We identify potential intermediaries and techniques of
   orchestration, and assess whether the HLPF can successfully act as an

Title = {{Distributive fairness: A mutual recognition approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{35-44}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Can norms of distributive fairness serve as pillars of a new and more
   effective global climate regime? Three general principles -
   responsibilities, capabilities (capacity), and needs (or rights) - are
   frequently invoked and rarely disputed. Yet, parties' interpretations
   often diverge, reflecting conflicts of interests. To determine how much
   is at stake, we compare -by means of a global integrated assessment
   model (GRACE) - 15 legitimate interpretations of `responsibilities' and
   `capabilities' in terms of their implications for the mitigation
   obligations and costs of seven potentially pivotal actors. Most of these
   interpretations yield similar results for most actors. In a scenario
   where global emissions in 2030 are reduced by 20\% compared to a
   business-as-usual baseline, mitigation costs vary by less than 1\% of
   GDP for the United States, the European Union, Japan, India, and China.
   For Brazil and Russia, however, variance is much larger. Moreover, for
   all actors, mitigation costs rise steeply as ambition levels increase.
   Under such circumstances, searching for a single `fairness-optimizing'
   formula is likely to fail. As negotiators explore systems of voluntary
   pledges, a more promising approach would conceive of fairness as a
   multidimensional construct and foster accommodation through mutual
   recognition of a limited range of legitimate norm interpretations. (C)

Abstract = {{Skewed distributions of benefits from natural resources can fuel social
   exclusion and conflict, threatening sustainability. This paper analyzes
   how user-group property rights to harvest forest products affect the
   distribution of benefits from those products within user groups. We
   argue that groups with recognized harvesting rights share benefits more
   equally among group members than groups without such rights. We test
   this argument with data from 350 forest user groups in 14 developing

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In response to unsustainable timber production in tropical forest
   concessions, voluntary forest management certification programs such as
   the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have been introduced to improve
   environmental, social, and economic performance over existing management
   practices. However, despite the proliferation of forest certification
   over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness.
   Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on
   environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia),
   we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions
   compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple
   difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC
   reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence
   of air pollution by 31\%. It had no statistically significant impacts on
   fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4
   km(2) on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood
   dependence (by 33\%), respiratory infections (by 32\%) and malnutrition
   (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical
   evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as
   Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and
   data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations
   of a potentially critical conservation policy.}},

Abstract = {{The first public product of the Intergovernmental Platform on

   This conceptual and analytical tool, presented here in detail, will
   underpin all IPBES functions and provide structure and comparability to
   the syntheses that IPBES will produce at different spatial scales, on
   different themes, and in different regions. Salient innovative aspects
   of the IPBES Conceptual Framework are its transparent and participatory
   construction process and its explicit consideration of diverse
   scientific disciplines, stakeholders, and knowledge systems, including
   indigenous and local knowledge. Because the focus on co-construction of
   integrative knowledge is shared by an increasing number of initiatives
   worldwide, this framework should be useful beyond IPBES, for the wider
   research and knowledge-policy communities working on the links between
   nature and people, such as natural, social and engineering scientists,
   policy-makers at different levels, and decision-makers in different
   sectors of society.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on institutional fit is developing rapidly within the
   broader discourse on sustainability which has resulted in a diverse, but
   sometimes inconsistent program of research. Therefore we review the
   recent literature on the fit between institutions and social-ecological
   systems to identify three general types of fit: namely, ecological fit,
   social fit and social-ecological system fit. Each of these draws
   attention to different dimensions of social-ecological systems, with
   their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is
   generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose
   immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build
   theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems. Therefore we present a
   typology which defines and summarizes the three major types of fit and
   can be used to organize and advance systematic theoretical and policy
   relevant inquiry.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{In 2014, United Nations member states proposed a set of Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs), which will succeed the Millennium Development
   Goals (MDGs) as reference goals for the international development
   community for the period 2015-2030. The proposed goals and targets can
   be seen as a network, in which links among goals exist through targets
   that refer to multiple goals. Using network analysis techniques, we show
   that some thematic areas covered by the SDGs are well connected with one
   another. Other parts of the network have weaker connections with the
   rest of the system. The SDGs as a whole are a more integrated system
   than the MDGs were, which may facilitate policy integration across
   sectors. However, many of the links among goals that have been
   documented in biophysical, economic and social dimensions are not
   explicitly reflected in the SDGs. Beyond the added visibility that the
   SDGs provide to links among thematic areas, attempts at policy
   integration across various areas will have to be based on studies of the
   biophysical, social and economic systems at appropriate scales.

Abstract = {{This paper examines the linkage between mobilization and elite capture
   in participatory institutions using a randomized experiment in Kenya. In
   the treatment group, an environmental organization mobilized individuals
   to attend a participatory local government planning meeting.
   Mobilization had a large and significant effect on citizen
   participation. Despite this effect, mobilization did not lead to
   increased adoption of either the organization's preferred projects or
   the projects requested by citizens. Instead, the intervention changes
   the type of discrepancies observed in final allocations, indicating that
   elite control over planning institutions can adapt to increased
   mobilization and participation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Coproductive capacities: rethinking science-governance relations in a
   diverse world}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Tackling major environmental change issues requires effective
   partnerships between science and governance, but relatively little work
   in this area has examined the diversity of settings from which such
   partnerships may, or may not, emerge. In this special feature we draw on
   experiences from around the world to demonstrate and investigate the
   consequences of diverse capacities and capabilities in bringing science
   and governance together. We propose the concept of coproductive
   capacities as a useful new lens through which to examine these
   relations. Coproductive capacity is ``the combination of scientific
   resources and governance capability that shapes the extent to which a
   society, at various levels, can operationalize relationships between
   scientific and public, private, and civil society institutions and
   actors to effect scientifically-informed social change.{''} This recasts
   the relationships between science and society from notions of ``gaps{''}
   to notions of interconnectedness and interplay (coproduction); alongside
   the societal foundations that shape what is or is not possible in that
   dynamic connection (capacities). The articles in this special feature
   apply this concept to reveal social, political, and institutional
   conditions that both support and inhibit high-quality environmental
   governance as global issues are tackled in particular places. Across
   these articles we suggest that five themes emerge as important to
   understanding coproductive capacity: history, experience, and
   perceptions; quality of relationships (especially in suboptimal
   settings); disjunct across scales; power, interests, and legitimacy; and
   alternative pathways for environmental governance. Taking a coproductive
   capacities perspective can help us identify which interventions may best
   enable scientifically informed, but locally sensitive approaches to
   environmental governance.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face
   of perturbations. Although resilience has been a highly influential
   concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we
   describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the
   basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon
   of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small
   perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point.
   Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be
   indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial
   patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience
   of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of
   observations as in long time series or satellite images. these generic
   approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific
   knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the
   resilience of complex systems.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive wealth is a measure designed to address whether society is on
   a sustainable development trajectory. Inclusive wealth is defined as the
   aggregate value of all capital assets. Increases in inclusive wealth
   indicate an improved productive base capable of supporting a higher
   standard of living in the future. To be truly inclusive, measures of
   inclusive wealth must include the value of all forms of capital that
   contribute to human well-being: human capital, manufactured capital,
   natural capital, and social capital. Sustainability concerns have
   increased attention on the ways of measuring the value of natural
   capital. We review various attempts to measure natural capital and to
   incorporate these into inclusive wealth including estimates using
   national wealth accounts and integrated ecological and economic models
   used to estimate ecosystem services. Empirically measuring the value of
   various types of capital in terms of a common metric is hugely
   challenging, and no current attempt to date can be said to be fully
   inclusive. Despite the empirical challenges, inclusive wealth provides a
   clear, coherent, and systematic framework for addressing sustainable
   development. Combining measures of semi-inclusive wealth that capture
   forms of capital that can be relatively easily measured in monetary
   terms with a set of biophysical metrics capturing important aspects of
   natural capital that are difficult to measure in monetary terms may
   provide a good set of signals of whether society is proceeding along a
   sustainable development trajectory.}},

   I analyze intersectionality as a knowledge project whose raison d'etre
   lies in its attentiveness to power relations and social inequalities. I
   examine three interdependent sets of concerns: (a) intersectionality as
   a field of study that is situated within the power relations that it
   studies; (b) intersectionality as an analytical strategy that provides
   new angles of vision on social phenomena; and (c) intersectionality as
   critical praxis that informs social justice projects.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},

Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{325-336}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The need to adapt to climate change is now widely recognised as evidence
   of its impacts on social and natural systems grows and greenhouse gas
   emissions continue unabated. Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as
   reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case
   studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of
   adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation
   science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and
   focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more
   systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and
   effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent
   decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are
   framed within a ``pathways{''} metaphor to emphasise the need for robust
   decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and
   inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such ``adaptation
   pathways{''} approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly
   identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they
   generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for
   adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of
   vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of
   ``adaptation pathways{''} that draws on `pathways thinking' in the
   sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path
   dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and
   global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions
   constrain societal responses to change. This reconceptualisation of
   adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating
   incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects
   of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The
   paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and
   procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of
   adaptation. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Since the World War II, many economies have transitioned from an
   agrarian, biomass-based to an industrial, minerals-based metabolic
   regime. Since 1950, world population grew by factor 2.7 and global
   material consumption by factor 3.7-71 Gigatonnes per year in 2010. The
   expansion of the resource base required by human societies is associated
   with growing pressure on the environment and infringement on the
   habitats of other species. In order to achieve a sustainability
   transition, we require a better understanding of the currently ongoing
   metabolic transition and its potential inertia. In this article, we
   present a long-term global material flow dataset covering material
   extraction, trade, and consumption of 177 individual countries between
   1950 and 2010. We trace patterns and trends in material flows for six
   major geographic and economic country groupings and world regions
   (Western Industrial, the (Former) Soviet Union and its allies, Asia, the
   Middle East and Northern Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and
   Sub-Saharan Africa) as well as their contribution to the emergence of a
   global metabolic profile during a period of rapid industrialization and
   globalization. Global average material use increased from 5.0 to 10.3
   tons per capita and year (t/cap/a) between 1950 and 2010. Regional
   metabolic rates range from 4.5 t/cap/a in Sub-Saharan Africa to 14.8
   t/cap/a in the Western Industrial grouping. While we can observe a
   stabilization of the industrial metabolic profile composed of relatively
   equal shares of biomass, fossil energy carriers, and construction
   minerals, we note differences in the degree to which other regions are
   gravitating toward a similar form of material use. Since 2000, Asia has
   overtaken the Western Industrial grouping in terms of its share in
   global resource use although not in terms of its per capita material
   consumption. We find that at a sub-global level, the roles of the world
   regions have changed. There are, however, no signs yet that this will
   lead to stabilization or even a reduction of global resource use. (C)

   ethical and outside the scope of economic analysis, we claim that there
   are converging and convincing arguments in favor of using an annual real
   risk-free discount rate going from approximately 4\% to approximately
   1\% for maturities going from zero to infinity. Investing in climate
   mitigation yields highly uncertain future benefits. Such uncertainty
   should also be taken into account in the selection of the discount rate,

Abstract = {{Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity,
   stability, invasibility, and nutrient dynamics. Hundreds of studies
   spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that
   high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as
   monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases
   through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes,
   including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting
   resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling
   feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long
   term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent
   with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common
   feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term
   coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an
   effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire,
   drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of
   environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of
   biodiversity should be a high global priority.}},

Abstract = {{Network concepts are central to at least three challenges of interest in
   the sustainability science literature: how to link knowledge with
   action, how to enhance collective action, and how to promote social
   learning. Although each challenge has developed into a coherent
   literature, social network concepts-which examine the particular ways in
   which social agents relate to one another-emerge as a common theme
   across all three challenges. To build a synthetic understanding of
   networks and sustainability, we must consider how structural properties
   of networks relate to sustainability outcomes, how networks evolve over
   time, and how institutional context influences this evolutionary
   process. A better understanding of these questions can inform strategies
   to promote patterns of social interaction that support sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, I review-and to an extent further develop-a normative
   theory that offers a unified language for both sustainability and policy
   analyses. The theory shows that by economic growth we should mean growth
   in wealth, which is the social worth of an economy's entire stock of
   capital assets, not growth in GDP or improvements in the many ad hoc
   indicators of human development that have been proposed in recent years.
   Concurrently, the theory shows that by poverty we should mean a low
   level of wealth, not income, and that the distribution of well-being
   ought to be judged in terms of the distribution of wealth, not income or
   education or the many indicators that are currently in use. I show that
   the concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of assets and the
   idea of investment well beyond conventional usage. This perspective has
   radical implications for the way that national accounts are prepared and
   interpreted. I then sketch a recent publication that has put the theory
   to work by studying the composition of wealth accumulation in
   contemporary India.}},

Abstract = {{The social-ecological system (SES) framework investigated in this
   special issue enables researchers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds
   working on different resource sectors in disparate geographic areas,
   biophysical conditions, and temporal domains to share a common
   vocabulary for the construction and testing of alternative theories and
   models that determine which influences on processes and outcomes are
   especially critical in specific empirical settings. We summarize changes
   that have been made to this framework and discuss a few remaining
   ambiguities in its formulation. Specifically, we offer a tentative
   rearrangement of the list of relevant attributes of governance systems
   and discuss other ways to make this framework applicable to policy
   settings beyond natural resource settings. The SES framework will
   continue to change as more researchers apply it to additional contexts;
   the main purpose of this article is to delineate the version that served
   as the basis for the theoretical innovations and empirical analyses
   detailed in other contributions to this special issue.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of sustainability' received serious attention in the so-called
   Brundtland Commission Report that has many attractive features. In
   particular, it highlighted the importance of intergenerational justice
   while maintaining a concern for the poor of each generation and shifted
   the focus away from resources to human beings. I argue that this way of
   understanding sustainability, while a great improvement, is still
   incomplete. There are important grounds for favouring a freedom-oriented
   view, focusing on crucial freedoms that people have reason to value.
   Human freedoms include the fulfilment of needs, but also the liberty to
   define and pursue our own goals, objectives and commitments, no matter
   how they link with our own particular needs. Human beings are reflective
   creatures and are able to reason about and decide what they would like
   to happen, rather than being compellingly led by their own
   needsbiological or social. A fuller concept of sustainability has to aim
   at sustaining human freedoms, rather than only at our ability to fulfil
   our felt needs. Some empirical examples are given to illustrate the
   distinctive nature and the reasoned importance of seeing sustainability
   in terms of sustaining human freedoms and capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Globalization, the process by which local social-ecological systems
   (SESs) are becoming linked in a global network, presents policy
   scientists and practitioners with unique and difficult challenges.
   Although local SESs can be extremely complex, when they become more
   tightly linked in the global system, complexity increases very rapidly
   as multi-scale and multi-level processes become more important. Here, we
   argue that addressing these multi-scale and multi-level challenges
   requires a collection of theories and models. We suggest that the
   conceptual domains of sustainability, resilience, and robustness provide
   a sufficiently rich collection of theories and models, but overlapping
   definitions and confusion about how these conceptual domains articulate
   with one another reduces their utility. We attempt to eliminate this
   confusion and illustrate how sustainability, resilience, and robustness
   can be used in tandem to address the multi-scale and multi-level
   challenges associated with global change.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is altering the productivity of natural resources with
   far-reaching implications for those who depend on them.
   Resource-dependent industries and communities need the capacity to adapt
   to a range of climate risks if they are to remain viable. In some
   instances, the scale and nature of the likely impacts means that
   transformations of function or structure will be required.
   Transformations represent a switch to a distinct new system where a
   different suite of factors become important in the design and
   implementation of response strategies. There is a critical gap in
   knowledge on understanding transformational capacity and its influences.
   On the basis of current knowledge on adaptive capacity we propose four
   foundations for measuring transformational capacity: (1) how risks and
   uncertainty are managed, (2) the extent of skills in planning, learning
   and reorganizing, (3) the level of financial and psychological
   flexibility to undertake change and (4) the willingness to undertake
   change. We test the influence of place attachment and occupational
   identity on transformational capacity using the Australian peanut
   industry, which is presently assessing significant structural change in
   response to predicted climatic changes. Survey data from 88\% of peanut
   farmers in Queensland show a strong negative correlation between
   transformational capacity and both place attachment and occupational
   attachment, suggesting that whilst these factors may be important
   positive influences on the capacity to adapt to incremental change, they
   act as barriers to transformational change.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability oriented innovation and technology studies have received
   increasing attention over the past 10-15 years. In particular, a new
   field dealing with ``sustainability transitions{''} has gained ground
   and reached an output of 60-100 academic papers per year. In this
   article, we aim to identify the intellectual contours of this emerging
   field by conducting a review of basic conceptual frameworks, together
   with bibliographical analysis of 540 journal articles in the field. It
   is against this background that we position the six papers assembled in
   a special section in Research Policy. These papers pave the way for new
   conceptual developments and serve as stepping-stones in the maturation
   of sustainability transition studies, by linking with the scholarly
   literatures of management studies, sociology, policy studies, economic
   geography, and modeling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We develop and apply a consistent and comprehensive theoretical
   framework for assessing whether economic growth is compatible with
   sustaining wellbeing over time. Our approach differs from earlier
   approaches by concentrating on wealth rather than income. Sustainability
   is demonstrated by showing that a properly defined comprehensive measure
   of wealth is maintained through time. Our wealth measure is unusually
   comprehensive, capturing not only reproducible and human capital but
   also natural capital, health improvements and technological change. We
   apply the framework to five countries: the United States, China, Brazil,
   India and Venezuela. We show that the often-neglected contributors to
   wealth - technological change, natural capital and health capital -
   fundamentally affect the conclusions one draws about whether given
   nations are achieving sustainability. Indeed, even countries that
   display sustainability differ considerably in the kinds of capital that
   contribute to it.}},

Abstract = {{The public trust doctrine (PTD) is a legal concept with ancient roots,
   and it is increasingly being examined as a framework for modern
   conservation. At its core, the PTD is based on the idea that certain
   natural resources cannot be fairly or effectively managed by private
   owners. Rather, these resources should be held in trust by government,
   which must manage their consumptive use and protection on behalf of
   present and future citizens. Although historically the PTD applied to a
   limited set of natural resources such as shellfish beds and submerged
   lands, courts and legal scholars have expanded the definition of trust
   resources to include wildlife, oceans, and ecosystem services generally.
   The wide range of interpretations of the PTD is seen as both a weakness
   (because it leads to uncertainty in property ownership) and a strength
   (because it can adapt to accommodate emerging science about what it
   takes to protect ecosystems).}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing the resilience of ecosystem services (ES) that underpin human
   well-being is critical for meeting current and future societal needs,
   and requires specific governance and management policies. Using the
   literature, we identify seven generic policy-relevant principles for
   enhancing the resilience of desired ES in the face of disturbance and
   ongoing change in social-ecological systems (SES). These principles are
   (P1) maintain diversity and redundancy, (P2) manage connectivity, (P3)
   manage slow variables and feedbacks, (P4) foster an understanding of SES
   as complex adaptive systems (CAS), (P5) encourage learning and
   experimentation, (P6) broaden participation, and (P7) promote
   polycentric governance systems. We briefly define each principle, review
   how and when it enhances the resilience of ES, and conclude with major
   research gaps. In practice, the principles often co-occur and are highly
   interdependent. Key future needs are to better understand these
   interdependencies and to operationalize and apply the principles in
   different policy and management contexts.}},

   are successful in solving the problems leading to their creation. This
   article provides a critical review of the literature on this topic. It
   extracts and summarizes what is known about the effectiveness of
   environmental regimes in the form of a series of general and specific
   propositions. It identifies promising topics for consideration in the
   next phase of research in this field. Additionally, it comments on the
   research strategies available to pursue this line of analysis. The
   general conclusions are that international environmental regimes can and
   do make a difference, although often in conjunction with a number of
   other factors, and that a strategy of using a number of tools combined
   can help to improve understanding of the determinants of success.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary
   success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part
   of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have
   become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities
   worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed
   as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of
   integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for
   development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis
   across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of
   scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution,
   geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration
   structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing
   explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the
   field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their
   interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining
   contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at
   very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional
   disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and
   ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy
   perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives
   has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence
   of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments
   demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of
   sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous
   scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and
   longevity.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2258-2267}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a coevolutionary framework for analysing a
   transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy, based on the coevolution
   of ecosystems, technologies, institutions, business strategies and user
   practices, within a multi-level micro-meso-macro perspective. This
   builds on and develops previous coevolutionary analyses of long-term
   technological and industrial change, and recent renewed interest within
   ecological economics on coevolutionary approaches. Previous work has
   analysed how the coevolution of technologies and institutions has led to
   the lock-in of current high-carbon energy systems; and how the
   coevolution of physical and social technologies and business strategies
   has brought significant material and welfare benefits to the minority of
   the world's population living in industrialised countries. The
   coevolutionary framework proposed here may be used to undertake: (1)
   detailed empirical analyses at a micro-meso level of the challenges
   relating to the innovation and adoption of particularly low-carbon
   technologies; (2) as a framework for analysing the multi-level
   interaction of social and technological elements within potential
   transition pathways to a low carbon energy system; (3) to assess the
   implications for economic growth and prosperity of a transition to a low
   carbon economy; and (4) to assist in the development of more formal,
   multi-level evolutionary economic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Global change issues are complex and the consequences of decisions are
   often highly uncertain. The large spatial and temporal scales and stakes
   involved make it important to take account of present and potential
   consequences in decision-making. Standard approaches to decision-making
   under uncertainty require information about the likelihood of
   alternative states, how states and actions combine to form outcomes and
   the net benefits of different outcomes. For global change issues,
   however, the set of potential states is often unknown, much less the
   probabilities, effect of actions or their net benefits. Decision theory,
   thresholds, scenarios and resilience thinking can expand awareness of
   the potential states and outcomes, as well as of the probabilities and
   consequences of outcomes under alternative decisions.}},

   This highlights the need to consider subjective and relational factors
   in addition to objective measures of capacity and to view these as
   reflexive and dynamic, as well as differentiated socially and

Abstract = {{In the context of governance of human-environment interactions, a
   panacea refers to a blueprint for a single type of governance system
   (e.g., government ownership, privatization, community property) that is
   applied to all environmental problems. The aim of this special feature
   is to provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to caution
   against the tendency, when confronted with pervasive uncertainty, to
   believe that scholars can generate simple models of linked
   social-ecological systems and deduce general solutions to the overuse of
   resources. Practitioners and scholars who fall into panacea traps
   falsely assume that all problems of resource governance can be
   represented by a small set of simple models, because they falsely
   perceive that the preferences and perceptions of most resource users are
   the same. Readers of this special feature will become acquainted with
   many cases in which panaceas fail. The articles provide an excellent
   overview of why they fail. Furthermore, the articles in this special
   feature address how scholars and public officials can increase the
   prospects for future sustainable resource use by facilitating a
   diagnostic approach in selecting appropriate starting points for
   governance and monitoring, as well as by learning from the outcomes of
   new policies and adapting in light of effective feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation is a process of deliberate change in anticipation of or in
   reaction to external stimuli and stress. The dominant research tradi
   tion on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an
   actor-centered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond
   to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of
   vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a
   more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of
   resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in
   identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience
   provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to
   identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between
   incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that
   the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across
   scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb
   perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that
   allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews research traditions of vulnerability to environmental
   change and the challenges for present vulnerability research in
   integrating with the domains of resilience and adaptation. Vulnerability
   is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses
   associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of
   capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of
   vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of
   these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to
   environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems
   linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of
   climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The
   challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible
   measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of
   risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the
   mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and
   resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability,
   adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and
   integration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a critical assessment of the field of common
   property. After discussing briefly the major findings and
   accomplishments of the scholarship on the commons, the paper pursues two
   strategies of critique. The first strategy of friendly critique accepts
   the basic assumptions of most writings on common property to show that
   scholars of commons have discovered far more variables that potentially
   affect resource management than is possible to analyze carefully. The
   paper identifies some potential means to address the problem of too many
   variables. The second line of critique proceeds differently. It asks how
   analyses of common property might change, and what they need to
   consider, if they loosen assumptions about sovereign selves and
   apolitical property rights institutions. My examination of these
   questions concludes this review with an emphasis on the need to (a)
   attend more carefully to processes of subject formation, and (b)
   investigate common property arrangements and associated subject
   positions with greater historical depth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper begins from the understanding that women's empowerment is
   about the process by which those who have been denied the ability to
   make strategic life choices acquire such an ability. A wide gap
   separates this processual understanding of empowerment from the more
   instrumentalist forms of advocacy which have required the measurement
   and quantification of empowerment. The ability to exercise choice
   incorporates three inter-related dimensions: resources (defined broadly
   to include not only access, but also future claims, to both material and
   human and social resources); agency (including processes of decision
   making, as well as less measurable manifestations of agency such as
   negotiation, deception and manipulation); and achievements (well-being
   outcomes). A number of studies of women's empowerment are analysed to
   make some important methodological points about the measurement of
   empowerment. The paper argues that these three dimensions of choice are
   indivisible in determining the meaning of an indicator and hence its
   validity as a measure of empowerment. The notion of choice is further
   qualified by referring to the conditions of choice, its content and
   consequences. These qualifications represent an attempt to incorporate
   the structural parameters of individual choice in the analysis of
   women's empowerment.}},
