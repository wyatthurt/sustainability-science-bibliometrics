Abstract = {{The main goal of this research is to evaluate the contributions of Green
   Chemistry as a potential tool to drive the transition to circularity.
   For this, we have carried out a bibliographic study, analyzing those
   documents, process, or experiences that dealt jointly with the Green
   Chemistry aspects related to circularity such circular economy,
   industrial ecology, and closed loop. Findings show that few authors have
   treated that disciplines together in the last 10 years. Based on an
   analysis of academic literature, common strategies (design, raw
   materials, life cycle assessment, processes, normative, new business,
   and collaboration), specific experiences (catalyst, biobased products
   ormethods, recycling, and reusing), and difficulties to overcome
   (metrics, transdisciplinary research, unawareness, and competitiveness)
   have been identified. Finally, different kind ofmeasures, as behind such
   joint metrics, informal open spaces, closer the industry, education,
   standards and label are proposed to facilitate the development of Green
   Chemistry, circular economy, industrial ecology, and closed loop with
   the ultimate goal of improving sustainable development.
   From the evidences found, we finally conclude that it is possible to use
   Green Chemistry and its principles as a tool to drive the transition to
   circularity, being the development of open spaces for exchange
   information between different actors fromacademia, governments and
   regulatory actors, business and industrial sectors, with the aim of
   promoting disruptive advances in sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{The material basis of a sustainable society will depend on chemical
   products and processes that are designed following principles that make
   them conducive to life. Important inherent properties of molecules need
   to be considered from the earliest stage-the design stage-to address
   whether compounds and processes are depleting versus renewable, toxic
   versus benign, and persistent versus readily degradable. Products,
   feedstocks, and manufacturing processes will need to integrate the
   principles of green chemistry and green engineering under an expanded
   definition of performance that includes sustainability considerations.
   This transformation will require the best of the traditions of science
   and innovation coupled with new emerging systems thinking and systems
   design that begins at the molecular level and results in a positive
   impact on the global scale.}},

Abstract = {{Forest transitions occur when net reforestation replaces net
   deforestation in places. Because forest transitions can increase
   biodiversity and augment carbon sequestration, they appeal to
   policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss and
   climate change. What then can policymakers do to trigger forest
   transitions? The historical record over the last two centuries provides
   insights into the precipitating conditions. The early transitions often
   occurred passively, through the spontaneous regeneration of trees on
   abandoned agricultural lands. Later forest transitions occurred more
   frequently after large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred
   governments to take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped
   lands. To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest
   transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with clearly
   articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover. These historical
   shifts in forest transitions reflect our growing appreciation of their
   utility for countering droughts, floods, land degradation, and climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates water security in Nepal from the perspective
   of the water-energy-agriculture (food) nexus, focusing on pathways to
   water security that originate in actions and policies related to other
   sectors. It identifies promoting development of Nepal's hydropower
   potential to provide energy for pumping as way to improve water security
   in agriculture. Renewable groundwater reserves of 1.4 billion cubic
   meters (BCM), from an estimated available balance of 6.9 BCM, could be
   pumped to irrigate 613,000 ha of rainfed agricultural land in the Terai
   plains, with a potential direct economic gain of USD 1.1 billion
   annually and associated benefits including promotion of energy-based
   industry, food security and local employment. Governance also plays an
   important role in addressing water security. We conclude that a
   nexus-based approach is required for effective water management and

Abstract = {{The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s,
   driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per
   capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever
   before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global
   declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of
   local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and
   the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital
   benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of
   life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy
   and the costs of reducing nature's benefits are unequally distributed.
   The fabric of life on which we all depend-nature and its contributions
   to people-is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats
   and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities
   exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such
   action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic,
   social, and technological causes of nature's deterioration.}},

   redistributing and reorienting power in socio-material change}},
Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines a variety of theories bearing on `socio-material
   incumbency' and explores methodological implications. The aim is to
   develop a systematic general approach, which builds on strengths and
   mitigates weaknesses in prevailing analytical frameworks. A particular
   priority lies in avoidance of self-acknowledged tendencies in existing
   theory to `reify' central notions like `the regime'. Such pictures may
   overstate the tractability of incumbency to conventional policy
   instruments and so inadvertently help reinforce it. Based on detailed
   analysis of ways in which longstanding concepts of structuration apply
   to socio-material change, a novel `configuring fields' approach is
   proposed. Contrasting `eagle-eye' and `worm-eye' views are each shown to
   yield distinctive possible `topologies of incumbency'. This results in
   testable hypotheses with potentially important practical implications.
   Attention can thus extend beyond narrow policy instruments and mixes, to
   fully embrace broader and deeper kinds of political collective action,
   culture change and democratic struggle.}},

Title = {{Power in global governance: an expanded typology from global health}},
Journal = {{GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1, 1}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The exercise of power permeates global governance processes, making
   power a critical concept for understanding, explaining, and influencing
   the intersection of global governance and health. This article briefly
   presents and discusses three well-established conceptualizations of
   power-Dahl's, Bourdieu's, and Barnett and Duvall's-from different
   disciplines, finding that each is important for understanding global
   governance but none is sufficient. The conceptualization of power itself
   needs to be expanded to include the multiple ways in which one actor can
   influence the thinking or actions of others. I further argue that global
   governance processes exhibit features of complex adaptive systems, the
   analysis of which requires taking into account multiple types of power.
   Building on established frameworks, the article then offers an expanded
   typology of eight kinds of power: physical, economic, structural,
   institutional, moral, discursive, expert, and network. The typology is
   derived from and illustrated by examples from global health, but may be
   applicable to global governance more broadly. Finally, one seemingly
   contradictory - and cautiously optimistic - conclusion emerges from this
   typology: multiple types of power can mutually reinforce tremendous
   power disparities in global health; but at the same time, such
   disparities are not necessarily absolute or immutable. Further research
   on the complex interaction of multiple types of power is needed for a
   better understanding of global governance and health.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATIC CHANGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{61-80}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The field of climate services has arisen rapidly out of a desire to
   enable climate science to meet the information needs of society to
   respond to climate variability and change. In order for knowledge to be
   ``usable{''} for decision-making, in the field of climate adaptation and
   beyond, it must meet the criteria of credibility, salience, and
   legitimacy (Cash et al., PNAS 100:8086-8091, 2003). Deliberate
   ``co-production{''} of knowledge between ``producers{''} and ``users{''}
   has the potential to increase usability for decision-making and policy
   in some contexts. While co-production is increasingly advanced as an
   instrumental approach to facilitate the production of usable climate
   services, such efforts have paid scant attention to the role of power
   relations. In this article, we bring together literature on normative
   approaches to co-production-which treats co-production as an
   instrumental means to an end-with analytical interpretations of
   co-production within the field of Science and Technology Studies to
   examine efforts to develop usable climate services in Tanzania. We show
   that without reflexive processes that are explicitly attentive to power
   dynamics, normative co-production within climate services development
   can serve to reinforce, rather than overcome, power imbalances among
   actors.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATIC CHANGE}},

Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Urban areas of developing countries face increasing risks due to climate
   change. This paper systematically identifies and examines research
   published between 2000 and 2017 that assesses urban adaptive capacity to
   climate change in developing countries. To critically examine this
   literature, we developed a conceptual framework of urban adaptive
   capacity. The framework focuses on key components of urban adaptive
   capacity in three dimensions: the characterization of adaptive capacity,
   the external factors mediating adaptive capacity, and the dynamics of
   adaptive capacity. The study sheds light on the spatial and scalar
   interactions of individuals, communities, and authorities' adaptive
   capacities within urban areas and highlights the importance of
   governance and social institutions in shaping urban adaptive capacity.
   The work also finds shortcomings in the current assessment of urban
   adaptive capacity, with key gaps including a narrow focus on the range
   and types of adaptive capacity; limited assessment of the multilevel
   determinants, place-based processes, and urban determinants that shape
   adaptive capacity; and a lack of consideration of adaptive capacity
   interactions between social entities and with regard to climate
   sensitivity and exposure of a given area, including the potential for
   maladaptation. Addressing these research gaps would contribute to
   generate knowledge that can adequately support adaptation planning of
   urban areas in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Remote less-favored agricultural lands (LFAL) are regions in developing
   countries that face severe biophysical constraints on production and are
   in geographical locations that have limited market access. We estimate
   that, across developing countries, 130 million people with high infant
   mortality live in such areas, and the incidence is 40\%. In low-income
   countries, the population in remote LFAL with high infant mortality
   increased 25\% over 2000-2010 to 57 million, and the incidence is 94\%.
   From case study evidence, we identify the key environmental and economic
   characteristics that influence the ability of rural households in remote
   LFAL to avoid poverty. We incorporate these characteristics in a model
   analyzing the behavior of a representative household, which illustrates
   conditions that enable the household to escape subsistence-level
   poverty. We also show empirically for 83 developing countries that the
   share of rural population on remote LFAL in 2000 affects the
   poverty-reducing impacts of per capita income growth over 2000-2012.}},

Title = {{Elite power in low-carbon transitions: A critical and interdisciplinary
   review}},
Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{57}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Modern energy systems have tended towards centralized control by states,
   and national and multinational energy companies. This implicates the
   power of elites in realizing low-carbon transitions. In particular,
   low-carbon transitions can create, perpetuate, challenge, or entrench
   the power of elites. Using a critical lens that draws from geography,
   political science, innovation studies, and social justice theory (among
   others), this article explores the ways in which transitions can
   exacerbate, reconfigure or be shaped by ``elite power.{''} It does so by
   offering a navigational approach that surveys a broad collection of
   diverse literatures on power. It begins by conceptualizing power across
   a range of academic disciplines, envisioning power as involving both
   agents (corrective influence) and structures (pervasive influence). It
   then elaborates different types of power and the interrelationship
   between different sources of power, with a specific focus on elites,
   including conceptualizing elite power, resisting elite power, and power
   frameworks. The Review then examines scholarship relevant to elite power
   in low-carbon transitions-including the multi-level perspective, Michel
   Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Anthony Giddens, Karl Marx, and other
   contextual approaches-before offering future research directions. The
   Review concludes that the power relations inherent in low-carbon
   transitions are asymmetrical but promisingly unstable. By better
   grappling with power analytically, descriptively, and even normatively,
   socially just and sustainable energy futures become not only more
   desirable but also more possible.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},

Number = {{19}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability studies educators in colleges and universities must
   identify and teach the knowledge, skills, and abilities their graduates
   will most need to advance sustainability while confronting perhaps the
   most serious, sweeping, and integrated set of challenges humanity has
   ever known. Using a rigorous grounded theory and hermeneutics based
   analysis/synthesis of the relevant literature, this study articulates
   and describes in depth a set of five competencies for the sustainability
   field and suggests potentially effective pedagogies for teaching them.
   Findings in the areas of both competencies and pedagogies for
   sustainability education imply the benefits of integrative, active,
   collaborative, and applied approaches to curriculum development and
   teaching-approaches that directly involve students in learning and
   practicing transdisciplinary engagement in service to sustainability.
   The Bachelor of Arts in Sustainability Studies program at Colorado
   Mountain College serves as an example of how the articulated competency
   framework is being applied to evaluate and enhance curriculum and
   learning outcomes. The competency framework and pedagogical
   recommendations offered may also serve as roadmaps for educators at
   other institutions who prepare graduates to address the pressing
   challenges of sustainability evident in communities, nations, and the

Abstract = {{Sustainability within planetary boundaries requires concerted action by
   individuals, governments, civil society and private actors. For the
   private sector, there is concern that the power exercised by
   transnational corporations generates, and is even central to, global
   environmental change. Here, we ask under which conditions transnational
   corporations could either hinder or promote a global shift towards
   sustainability. We show that a handful of transnational corporations
   have become a major force shaping the global intertwined system of
   people and planet. Transnational corporations in agriculture, forestry,
   seafood, cement, minerals and fossil energy cause environmental impacts
   and possess the ability to influence critical functions of the
   biosphere. We review evidence of current practices and identify six
   observed features of change towards `corporate biosphere stewardship',
   with significant potential for upscaling. Actions by transnational
   corporations, if combined with effective public policies and improved
   governmental regulations, could substantially accelerate sustainability
   efforts.}},

Title = {{Sustainable development goal indicators: Analyzing trade-offs and
   complementarities}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{295-305}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has largely
   focused on formulating appropriate targets and indicators for each goal.
   Much less attention has been devoted to estimating possible tradeoffs
   and complementarities in attaining the various SDGs. Yet such tradeoffs
   and complementarities clearly exist. We develop an analytical model to
   estimate the welfare effects of progress in attaining one SDG while
   accounting for interactions in achieving other SDGs. We assess
   quantitatively progress in the SDGs over 2000-2016 at the global level
   and for low-income countries, using a representative indicator for each
   goal. We then estimate the welfare changes for improvements in No
   Poverty (SDG1) net of any welfare gains and losses in attaining each of
   the remaining 16 goals. For the world, we estimate the per capita
   welfare change of reductions in 2000-2016 poverty rates net of any gains
   or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals is \$12,737 per
   capita. This is more than double the welfare change of \$5671 per person
   for poverty reduction alone from 2000 to 2016. However, once
   interactions with other SDGs are taken into account, the net welfare
   change for poverty reduction in poor economies from 2000 to 2016 is
   \$244 per person, which is almost 20\% lower than the welfare estimate
   of \$299 per capita of poverty reduction on its own. Such an analysis
   helps policy makers prioritize improvements towards one goal or set of
   goals, and show explicitly the net gains and losses for achieving one
   goal while impacting others. For example, over 2000-2016 the world may
   have come closer to attaining the No Poverty goal, but at the expense of
   other critical SDGs, especially those associated with the environment.
   This research has important implications for achieving sustainability
   through pursuit of the SDGs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The community of species, human institutions, and human activities at a
   given location have been shaped by historical conditions (both mean and
   variability) at that location. Anthropogenic climate change is now
   adding strong trends on top of existing natural variability. These
   trends elevate the frequency of ``surprises{''}-conditions that are
   unexpected based on recent history. Here, we show that the frequency of
   surprising ocean temperatures has increased even faster than expected
   based on recent temperature trends. Using a simple model of human
   adaptation, we show that these surprises will increasingly challenge
   natural modes of adaptation that rely on historical experience. We also
   show that warming rates are likely to shift natural communities toward
   generalist species, reducing their productivity and diversity. Our work
   demonstrates increasing benefits for individuals and institutions from
   betting that trends will continue, but this strategy represents a
   radical shift that will be difficult for many to make.}},

   Imagination in Intergovernmental Science-Policy Scenario Processes}},
Journal = {{ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Scenario development has been recognized as a potential method to
   explore future change and stimulate a reflective process that can
   contribute to more informed decision-making. The assessment process
   under IPBES (the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
   Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) has however shown that the current
   predominantly biophysical and economic models and scenario processes for
   exploring the future of biodiversity, ecosystem services and their
   contributions to human wellbeing are insufficient to capture the
   complexity and context-specific nature of the problems facing these
   sectors. Several important challenges have been identified that require
   a more in-depth analysis of where more imaginative scenario efforts can
   be undertaken to address this gap. In this paper, we identify six key
   characteristics necessary for scenario processes: adaptability across
   diverse contexts, inclusion of diverse knowledge and value systems,
   legitimate stakeholder engagement that foregrounds the role of power and
   politics, an ability to grapple with uncertainty, individual and
   collective thinking mechanisms and relevance to policy making. We
   compared four cases of imaginative, arts-based scenario processes that
   each offer aspects of meeting these criteria. These approaches emphasise
   the importance of engaging the imagination of those involved in a
   process and harnessing it as a tool for identifying and conceptualising
   more transformative future trajectories. Drawing on the existing
   literature, we argue that there is value in fostering more inclusive and
   creative participatory processes that acknowledge the importance of
   understanding multiple value systems and relationships in order to
   reimagine a more inclusive and just future. Based on this, we reflect on
   future research to understand the transformative role that imagination
   can play in altering and enhancing knowledge-making for global
   assessments, including IPBES. We conclude that creative scenario
   co-development processes that promote imagination and create an opening
   for more empathetic responses should be considered as complementary
   tools within the suite of methodologies used for future IPBES scenario
   development.}},

Journal = {{POLICY STUDIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{534-555}},

Abstract = {{The imperative to ``link knowledge and action{''} is widely invoked as a
   defining characteristic of sustainability research. The complexities of
   sustainability challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss
   mean that linear models of knowledge and action, where knowledge is
   produced first (by researchers) then ``applied to{''} action (by policy
   actors), are considered insufficient. Researchers have developed more
   dynamic, open-ended and collaborative forms of policy engagement such as
   transdisciplinary and co-production research. Although promising these
   approaches often remain captive to linear assumptions that hinder their
   transformative potential. We contribute by providing a relational model
   of knowledge and action rooted in contemporary practice theory. A
   practice-based approach suggests the primary task of participants in
   transdisciplinary interventions is to find workable solutions to
   situations of dynamic complexity that are fundamentally indeterminate
   and unpredictable. Knowledge is not ``applied to{''} action, but drawn
   upon, produced and used from within the situation at hand, allowing
   researchers and policy actors alike to better harness the emergent
   character of situational developments and outcomes. A practice-based
   approach provides a conceptual language that captures the experienced
   complexities of intervening for sustainability, reconfigures the nature
   of ``actionable knowledge,{''} and identifies appropriate modes of
   evaluation for transdisciplinary and co-produced research.}},

Abstract = {{Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex adaptive systems.
   Social-ecological system phenomena, such as regime shifts,
   transformations, or traps, emerge from interactions among and between
   human and nonhuman entities within and across scales. Analyses of SES
   phenomena thus require approaches that can account for (1) the
   intertwinedness of social and ecological processes and (2) the ways they
   jointly give rise to emergent social-ecological patterns, structures,
   and dynamics that feedback on the entities and processes that generated
   them. We have developed a framework of linked action situations (AS) as
   a tool to capture those interactions that are hypothesized to have
   jointly and dynamically generated a social-ecological phenomenon of
   interest. The framework extends the concept of an action situation to
   provide a conceptualization of SES that focusses on social-ecological
   interactions and their links across levels. The aim of our SE-AS
   (social-ecological action situations) framework is to support a process
   of developing hypotheses about configurations of ASs that may explain an
   emergent social-ecological phenomenon. We suggest six social-ecological
   ASs along with social and ecological action situations that can commonly
   be found in natural resource or ecosystem management contexts. We test
   the ability of the framework to structure an analysis of processes of
   emergence by applying it to different case studies of regime shifts,
   traps, and sustainable resource use. The framework goes beyond existing
   frameworks and approaches, such as the SES framework or causal loop
   diagrams, by establishing a way of analyzing SES that focuses on the
   interplay of social-ecological interactions with the emergent outcomes
   they produce. We conclude by discussing the added value of the framework
   and discussing the different purposes it can serve: from supporting the
   development of theories of the emergence of social-ecological phenomena,
   enhancing transparency of SES understandings to serving as a boundary
   object for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.}},

Title = {{Exploring the usefulness of scenario archetypes in science-policy
   processes: experience across IPBES assessments}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Scenario analyses have been used in multiple science-policy assessments
   to better understand complex plausible futures. Scenario archetype
   approaches are based on the fact that many future scenarios have similar
   underlying storylines, assumptions, and trends in drivers of change,
   which allows for grouping of scenarios into typologies, or archetypes,
   facilitating comparisons between a large range of studies. The use of
   scenario archetypes in environmental assessments foregrounds important
   policy questions and can be used to codesign interventions tackling
   future sustainability issues. Recently, scenario archetypes were used in
   four regional assessments and one ongoing global assessment within the
   Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services (IPBES). The aim of these assessments was to provide decision
   makers with policy-relevant knowledge about the state of biodiversity,
   ecosystems, and the contributions they provide to people. This paper
   reflects on the usefulness of the scenario archetype approach within
   science-policy processes, drawing on the experience from the IPBES
   assessments. Using a thematic analysis of (a) survey data collected from
   experts involved in the archetype analyses across IPBES assessments, (b)
   notes from IPBES workshops, and (c) regional assessment chapter texts,
   we synthesize the benefits, challenges, and frontiers of applying the
   scenario archetype approach in a science-policy process. Scenario
   archetypes were perceived to allow syntheses of large amounts of
   information for scientific, practice-, and policy-related purposes,
   streamline key messages from multiple scenario studies, and facilitate
   communication of them to end users. In terms of challenges, they were
   perceived as subjective in their interpretation, oversimplifying
   information, having a limited applicability across scales, and
   concealing contextual information and novel narratives. Finally, our
   results highlight what methodologies, applications, and frontiers in
   archetype-based research should be explored in the future. These
   advances can assist the design of future large-scale
   sustainability-related assessment processes, aiming to better support
   decisions and interventions for equitable and sustainable futures.}},

Abstract = {{The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on
   Climate Change call for deep transformations in every country that will
   require complementary actions by governments, civil society, science and
   business. Yet stakeholders lack a shared understanding of how the 17
   SDGs can be operationalized. Drawing on earlier work by The World in
   2050 initiative, we introduce six SDG Transformations as modular
   building-blocks of SDG achievement: (1) education, gender and
   inequality; (2) health, well-being and demography; (3) energy
   decarbonization and sustainable industry; (4) sustainable food, land,
   water and oceans; (5) sustainable cities and communities; and (6)
   digital revolution for sustainable development. Each Transformation
   identifies priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for
   actions by well-defined parts of government working with business and
   civil society. Transformations may therefore be operationalized within
   the structures of government while respecting the strong
   interdependencies across the 17 SDGs. We also outline an action agenda
   for science to provide the knowledge required for designing,
   implementing and monitoring the SDG Transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Social-ecological network (SEN) concepts and tools are increasingly used
   in human-environment and sustainability sciences. We take stock of this
   budding research area to further show the strength of SEN analysis for
   complex human-environment settings, identify future synergies between
   SEN and wider human-environment research, and provide guidance about
   when to use different kinds of SEN approaches and models. We
   characterize SEN research along a spectrum specifying the degree of
   explicit network representation of system components and dynamics. We
   then systematically review one end of this spectrum, what we term `fully
   articulated SEN' studies, which specifically model unique social and
   ecological units and relationships. Results show a larger number of
   papers focus on methodological advancement and applied ends. While there
   has been some development and testing of theories, this remains an area
   for future work and would help develop SENs as a unique field of
   research, not just a method. Authors have studied diverse systems, while
   mainly focusing on the problem of social-ecological fit alongside a
   scattering of other topics. There is strong potential, however, to
   engage other issues central to human-environment studies. Analyzing the
   simultaneous effects of multiple social, environmental, and coupled
   processes, change over time, and linking network structures to outcomes
   are also areas for future advancement. This review provides a
   comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN research, a
   necessary step that can help scholars develop comparable cases and fill
   research gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Each year businesses, governments, and homeowners in the United States
   invest around one fifth of gross domestic product into the creation of
   capital assets such as buildings, machinery, and software to enable
   production and consumption. Use of capital is typically included to some
   extent in environmental life cycle assessments of goods and services but
   is not incorporated into most environmentally extended input-output
   (EEIO) models, including the US Environmental Protection Agency's
   USEEIO. Capital assets are typically created in years prior to their
   use, so a challenge lies in distributing the impacts of their creation
   over time. In this work, a highly detailed capital flow matrix approach
   is followed to distribute the use of fixed capital assets to consuming
   industries. Data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis's Fixed Asset
   Accounts is merged with its Industry Accounts data by the creation of
   concordance tables. Public highways and streets are partially
   reallocated to industries operating vehicles. The resulting capital use
   matrix is later combined into a modified USEEIO. ``Housing{''} is found
   to be the largest consumer of fixed assets, followed by general
   government, fossil fuel extraction, and financial industries involved in
   leasing. Construction, vehicles, and machinery are mostly used by
   industries in the form of fixed assets. The types of fixed assets used
   by industries are consistent with expectations: housing is dominated by
   structures, transport by equipment, and information industries by

Abstract = {{This article discusses the socio-technical transition literature,
   particularly the Multi-Level Perspective, which investigates the
   fundamental changes in (energy, transport, housing, agro-food) systems
   that are needed to address persistent sustainability problems. The
   article positions the MLP within the wider academic debate on
   sustainability transformations, and reviews criticisms and seven recent
   elaborations of the MLP with regard to: (1) politics and power, (2)
   cultural discourse and framing struggles, (3) grassroots innovation, (4)
   multiple transition pathways, (5) incumbent firm resistance and
   reorientation, (6) destabilization and decline, (7) policy analysis.
   Mobilizing insights from the wider social sciences, these elaborations
   have nuanced and differentiated the understanding of socio-technical
   transitions to sustainability and made the MLP the central pillar of a
   multi-facetted, cumulative research programme with a broad empirical
   evidence base.}},

Abstract = {{The potential consequences of cross-scale systemic environmental risks
   with global effects are increasing. We argue that current descriptions
   of globally connected systemic risk poorly capture the role of
   human-environment interactions. This creates a bias towards solutions
   that ignore the new realities of the Anthropocene. We develop an
   integrated concept of what we denote Anthropocene risk-that is, risks
   that: emerge from human-driven processes; interact with global
   social-ecological connectivity; and exhibit complex, cross-scale
   relationships. To illustrate this, we use four cases: moisture recycling
   teleconnections, aquaculture and stranded assets, biome migration in the
   Sahel, and sea-level rise and megacities. We discuss the implications of
   Anthropocene risk across several research frontiers, particularly in the
   context of supranational power, environmental and social externalities
   and possible future Anthropocene risk governance. We conclude that
   decision makers must navigate this new epoch with new tools, and that
   Anthropocene risk contributes conceptual guidance towards a more
   sustainable and just future.}},

Title = {{Rethinking power and institutions in the shadows of neoliberalism (An
   introduction to a special issue of World Development)}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{133-146}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite the recognition that institutions matter for international
   development, the debates over institutional reforms tend to obscure the
   role of power. Neoliberal models of development are often promoted in
   terms of their technical merits and efficiency gains and rarely account
   for the multiple ways that social, economic and political power shape
   institutional design and institutional change. Even recent efforts to
   address power tend to conceptualize it too narrowly. This special issue
   seeks to rethink the role of power in institutional creation and change
   in the context of persistent neoliberalism. In the introduction, we
   synthesize the literature on the nature of power to develop a new
   conceptual framework-a power in institutions matrix-that highlights the
   multiple dimensions of power involved in institutional development and
   change. We argue that such a theoretically-informed mapping of power in
   institutions will enable scholars, practitioners, and citizen groups to
   go beyond the standard critiques in order to analyze the multifaceted
   effects of neoliberal institutional change. Our introduction draws on an
   extensive literature review as well as the special issue contributors
   who examine institutional change in a variety of policy sectors in
   Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North America. We find that a
   range of diverse local, national and transnational actors, with
   disparate access to power, negotiate institutional changes from above
   and below through overt imposition of and resistance to new rules,
   influence of agendas, and promotion of discourses. Neoliberalism thus
   creates a new distributive politics. The special issue thus offers a
   theoretically-grounded approach for linking international and domestic
   power differences to the process of institutional change, with a
   specific focus on equity and sustainability. In a departure from the
   current literature's focus on elite bargains, we showcase the efforts by
   less powerful groups to gain a foothold in decision-making processes.

Title = {{Augmenting the IAD framework to reveal power in collaborative governance

Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{159-168}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Collaborative governance is often used as a strategy to address
   seemingly intractable common pool resource (CPR) problems. However,
   significant power imbalances can constrain the creation, adoption and
   implementation of socially and environmentally desirable policies. This
   study integrates theory on power with the institutional analysis and
   design (IAD) framework in order to provide a conceptual framework for
   examining power that is not captured through the IAD's focus on action
   situations. We examined the use of collaboration in CPR governance
   contexts characterized by significant power imbalances. Two Canadian
   collaborative processes that involve large energy industry interests
   were studied. We assessed the ability of these collaborative processes
   to address social and environmental goals. Results revealed significant
   hidden power dynamics related to inaction and non-decisions.
   Collaboration was unable to produce progressive outcomes because of i)
   the restriction of the collaborative agenda by powerful actors; ii)
   selective enforcement of rules; and; iii) a broader neoliberal context
   that inherently favoured increasing resource extraction. These findings
   indicate that the achievement of progressive social and environmental
   outcomes through collaboration is constrained where powerful resource
   industries are present as participants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{257+}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{Increasing global food demand, low grain reserves and climate change
   threaten the stability of food systems on national to global
   scales(1-5). Policies to increase yields, irrigation and tolerance of
   crops to drought have been proposed as stability-enhancing
   solutions(1,6,7). Here we evaluate a complementary possibility-that
   greater diversity of crops at the national level may increase the
   year-to-year stability of the total national harvest of all crops
   combined. We test this crop diversity-stability hypothesis using 5
   decades of data on annual yields of 176 crop species in 91 nations. We
   find that greater effective diversity of crops at the national level is
   associated with increased temporal stability of total national harvest.
   Crop diversity has stabilizing effects that are similar in magnitude to
   the observed destabilizing effects of variability in precipitation. This
   greater stability reflects markedly lower frequencies of years with
   sharp harvest losses. Diversity effects remained robust after
   statistically controlling for irrigation, fertilization, precipitation,
   temperature and other variables, and are consistent with the
   variance-scaling characteristics of individual crops required by
   theory(8,9) for diversity to lead to stability. Ensuring stable food
   supplies is a challenge that will probably require multiple solutions.
   Our results suggest that increasing national effective crop diversity
   may be an additional way to address this challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to address unsustainable global change is often attributed to
   failures in conventional environmental governance. Polycentric
   environmental governance-the popular alternative-involves many centres
   of authority interacting coherently for a common governance goal. Yet,
   longitudinal analysis reveals many polycentric systems are struggling to
   cope with the growing impacts, pace, and scope of social and
   environmental change. Analytic shortcomings are also beginning to
   appear, particularly in the treatment of power. Here we draw together
   diverse social science perspectives and research into a variety of cases
   to show how different types of power shape rule setting, issue
   construction, and policy implementation in polycentric governance. We
   delineate an important and emerging research agenda for polycentric
   environmental governance, integrating diverse types of power into

Abstract = {{Background: The Planetary Boundaries concept (PBc) has emerged as a key
   global sustainability concept in international sustainable development
   arenas. Initially presented as an agenda for global sustainability
   research, it now shows potential for sustainability governance. Weuse
   the fact that it is widely cited in scientific literature (>3500
   citations) and an extensively studied concept to analyse how it has been
   used and developed since its first publication. Design: From the
   literature that cites the PBc, we select those articles that have the
   terms `planetary boundaries' or `safe operating space' in either title,
   abstract or keywords. Weassume that this literature substantively
   engages with and develops the PBc. Results: Wefind that 6\% of the
   citing literature engages with the concept. Within this fraction of the
   literature we distinguish commentaries-that discuss the context and
   challenges to implementing the PBc, articles that develop the core
   biogeophysical concept and articles that apply the concept by
   translating to sub-global scales and by adding a human component to it.
   Applied literature adds to the concept by explicitly including society
   through perspectives of impacts, needs, aspirations and behaviours.
   Discussion: Literature applying the concept does not yet include the
   more complex, diverse, cultural and behavioural facet of humanity that
   is implied in commentary literature. Wesuggest there is need for a
   positive framing of sustainability goals-as a Safe Operating Space
   rather than boundaries. Key scientific challenges include distinguishing
   generalised from context-specific knowledge, clarifying which processes
   are generalizable and which are scalable, and explicitly applying
   complex systems' knowledge in the application and development of the
   PBc. Weenvisage that opportunities to address these challenges will
   arise when more human social dimensions are integrated, as we learn to
   feed the global sustainability vision with a plurality of bottom-up
   realisations of sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving effective, sustainable environmental governance requires a
   better understanding of the causes and consequences of the complex
   patterns of interdependencies connecting people and ecosystems within
   and across scales. Network approaches for conceptualizing and analysing
   these interdependencies offer one promising solution. Here, we present
   two advances we argue are needed to further this area of research: (i) a
   typology of causal assumptions explicating the causal aims of any given
   network-centric study of social-ecological interdependencies; (ii)
   unifying research design considerations that facilitate conceptualizing
   exactly what is interdependent, through what types of relationships and
   in relation to what kinds of environmental problems. The latter builds
   on the appreciation that many environmental problems draw from a set of
   core challenges that re-occur across contexts. We demonstrate how these
   advances combine into a comparative heuristic that facilitates
   leveraging case-specific findings of social-ecological interdependencies
   to generalizable, yet context-sensitive, theories based on explicit
   assumptions of causal relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The striking economic agglomerations emerging in affluent democracies
   are generating, reproducing, and expanding inequalities. A major
   mechanism for this is housing, which is both a repository for wealth
   and, under these conditions, a magnifier of wealth. Access to urban
   areas - the site of educational, labor, and marriage market advantages -
   is contingent upon access to housing. We use comparative analysis of
   cases in Europe (London and Paris) and the United States (New York and
   San Francisco) to consider the capacities of different societies to
   limit or ameliorate these new sources of diverging opportunity. These
   seemingly local issues remain shaped by distinct national political
   contexts, which vary dramatically in their capacity to support local
   affordable housing and reduce the collective action problems confronting
   major metropolitan areas.}},

Title = {{Mapping diverse visions of energy transitions: co-producing

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Theneed to rapidly decarbonise energy systems is widely accepted, yet
   there is growingcriticism oftop-down', technocentric transition visions.
   Transitions are,such critics claim, unpredictable,contested, and
   comprise of multiple andcompeting perspectives. This paper opens up to
   diversevisions of energytransitions by studying a corpus of 12 visions
   produced across differentinstitutional settings' of the state, business,
   science and technology, and civil society in the UK. We introduce a new
   analytical framework grounded in relational co-productionist
   perspectives in science and technology studies (STS) to comparatively
   analysethe similarities and differences of the visions in relation
   tofour dimensions ofsociotechnical transformation: meanings, knowings,
   doings, and organisings. Whilstresearch on energy transitions often
   focuses on dominant imaginaries withinpolitical cultures, regimes
   andcentres of power, it is an explicit intention of this paperto also
   comparatively map the distributed,diverse and counter-hegemonic visions.
   Thepaper reveals that what is often presented as a primarily
   technical'transition is always normativein bringing forward particular
   forms of socialand political order. Our analysis reveals
   importantdistinctions between morecentred' and more decentred or
   alternative' imaginaries of the energy transition, differences which
   reveal the inherently political nature of energy futures. Visions which
   emerge from civilsociety settings are shown to be a key locus of
   diversity in sociotechnical imaginaries and tend to open up to
   alternative models of progress, social change, and the roles of publics.
   This emphasises the significant role played by the settings and the
   make-up of collective practices through which energy visions are
   co-produced. We suggest that mapping diverse visions to reveal their
   respective partialities, exclusions and sociopolitical dimensions in
   this way, can offer a more humble, reflexive, and responsible foundation
   for practices of future-making and sociotechnical transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Access to ecosystem services and influence on their management are
   structured by social relations among actors, which often occur across
   spatial scales. Such cross-scale social relations can be analysed
   through a telecoupling framework as decisions taken at local scales are
   often shaped by actors at larger scales. Analyzing these cross-scale
   relations is critical to create effective and equitable strategies to
   manage ecosystem services. Here, we develop an analytical framework
   -i.e. the `cross-scale influence-dependence framework'- to facilitate
   the analysis of power asymmetries and the distribution of ecosystem
   services among the beneficiaries. We illustrate the suitability of this
   framework through its retrospective application across four case
   studies, in which we characterize the level of dependence of multiple
   actors on a particular set of ecosystem services, and their influence on
   decision-making regarding these services across three spatial scales.
   The `cross-scale influence-dependence framework' can improve our
   understanding of distributional and procedural equity and thus support
   the development of policies for sustainable management of ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about the impact on large-scale earth systems have taken center
   stage in the scientific and economic analysis of climate change. The
   present study analyzes the economic impact of a potential disintegration
   of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS). The study introduces an approach that
   combines long-run economic growth models, climate models, and
   reduced-form GIS models. The study demonstrates that social cost-benefit
   analysis and damage-limiting strategies can be usefully extended to
   illuminate issues with major long-term consequences, as well as concerns
   such as potential tipping points, irreversibility, and hysteresis. A key
   finding is that, under a wide range of assumptions, the risk of GIS
   disintegration makes a small contribution to the optimal stringency of
   current policy or to the overall social cost of climate change. It finds
   that the cost of GIS disintegration adds less than 5\% to the social
   cost of carbon (SCC) under alternative discount rates and estimates of
   the GIS dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
   Ecosystem Services (IPBES) aims to bridge between science and policy by
   assessing and synthesizing diverse forms of knowledge about
   biodiversity. With its explicit ambition to include not just natural
   science, but also social science and humanities as well as indigenous
   and local knowledge systems, IPBES is operating as a pioneer in
   uncharted territory. This Review assesses the state of research on IPBES
   processes in order to identify the challenges and lessons to be drawn
   from its efforts to include different kinds of experts, stakeholders and
   knowledge systems. The Review discusses both procedural and substantive
   dimensions of inclusiveness and identifies a paradox between on the one
   hand IPBES' demand for diversity and on the other hand its aim of
   achieving consensus. Specifically, it illustrates how IPBES' orientation
   towards consensus in decision-making and in assessment work shapes and
   constrains diversity and inclusiveness. This finding has implications
   for environmental assessment processes within and beyond IPBES and
   suggests a need to open up procedures and practices of participation and
   inclusion in order to accommodate pluralism, contestation and
   incommensurable perspectives and knowledge systems.}},

Abstract = {{Research on sustainability transitions has expanded rapidly in the last
   ten years, diversified in terms of topics and geographical applications,

   an extensive review and an updated research agenda for the field,

   social movements; businesses and industries; transitions in practice and
   everyday life; geography of transitions; ethical aspects; and
   methodologies. The review shows that the scope of sustainability
   transitions research has broadened and connections to established
   disciplines have grown stronger. At the same time, we see that the grand
   challenges related to sustainability remain unsolved, calling for
   continued efforts and an acceleration of ongoing transitions. Transition
   studies can play a key role in this regard by creating new perspectives,
   approaches and understanding and helping to move society in the

Pages = {{167-179}},

Abstract = {{The concept of wicked problems has served as an inspiration for research
   in a variety of research fields but has also contributed to conceptual
   confusion through the various ways in which it has been defined and
   used. In this special issue, a number of ontological, theoretical and
   methodological issues are discussed. First, while its use as a buzzword
   has undermined precise conceptual definition, recent work goes beyond
   the wicked versus tame dichotomy and conceptualizes wickedness as a
   matter of degree, differentiates between dimensions of wickedness and
   emphasizes the relational character of problem definitions. Second, new
   and existing governance approaches have often been unproblematically
   proposed as ways to solve wicked problems, while only imperfect
   solutions, partial solutions or small wins are achievable in practice.
   Third, the concept of wicked problems has had little direct impact on
   policy theories, and while some argue that the analysis of wicked
   problems should be mainstreamed in public policy thinking, others
   propose to reject the concept and rely on existing policy theories.
   Fourth, as a concept used in policy practice, wicked problems tend to
   provoke either paralysis or an overestimation of what policy can do
   about wicked problems. Possible ways forward include (1) leaving the
   concept behind; (2) using the wicked problems literature as knowledge
   base to understand when and why policy and governance approaches fail;
   and (3) developing dimensions of wicked problems (i.e. conflict,
   complexity and uncertainty) into more analytically precise research
   tools and linking them with more closely with contemporary policy
   science developments.}},

Abstract = {{The UN Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
   Development (herein, Agenda 30) and the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) offer both a set of aspirations for the kind of future we would
   like to see for the world and a suite of targets and indicators to
   support goal implementation. Goal 4 promotes quality education and
   Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However,
   creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been
   challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful
   assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across
   complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We
   then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous
   competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal
   competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal
   learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through
   exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use
   of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in
   achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We
   concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require
   individuals to acquire key competencies', aligning with notions of
   transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context
   specific competencies.}},

   and emotional dimensions of environmental change to understand how

   shape empathy's role in pro-environmental sustainability behaviour. We

Abstract = {{With a range of potential pathways to a sustainable future compatible
   with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degrees C target, scenario analysis has
   emerged as a key tool in studies of climate change mitigation and
   adaptation. A wide range of alternative scenarios have been created, and
   core amongst these are five socio-economic scenarios (Shared
   Socio-economic Pathways or SSPs) and four emission scenarios
   (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs). Whilst mitigation
   scenarios (the Shared Policy Assumptions, or SPAS) have been developed
   for each SSP-RCP combination, describing the actions necessary to match
   the climate pathway of the RCP, there has not yet been a systematic
   approach to address whether and how these actions can be enabled in
   practice.
   We present a novel and transferable framework to understand society's
   capacity to achieve the 1.5 degrees C target, based on four
   participatory case studies using the SSP-RCP scenarios. The methodology
   builds on a framework for categorising different types of societal
   capitals and capacities and assessing their impact on the potential to
   implement different types of mitigation actions. All four case studies
   show that SSP1 has the highest potential to reach the target. Although
   environmental awareness is high in both SSP1 and SSP4, continued social
   inequalities in SSP4 restrict society's capacity to transform, despite
   economic growth. In the two least environmentally-aware SSPs, SSP3 and
   SSP5, the transformation potential is low, but the view on capitals and
   capacities nonetheless helps identify opportunities for actors to
   develop and implement mitigation actions.
   The study highlights that techno-economic assessments of climate
   strategies need to be complemented by consideration of the critical role
   played by social and human capital, and by societal capacity to mobilise
   and create these capitals despite different socio-economic trends. These
   capitals and capacities are essential to enable the rapid innovation,
   behavioural change and international co-ordination needed to achieve the
   1.5 degrees C target.}},

Abstract = {{Effective science communication requires assembling scientists with
   knowledge relevant to decision makers, translating that knowledge into
   useful terms, establishing trusted two-way communication channels,
   evaluating the process, and refining it as needed. Communicating Science
   Effectively: A Research Agenda {[}National Research Council (2017)]
   surveys the scientific foundations for accomplishing these tasks, the
   research agenda for improving them, and the essential collaborative
   relations with decision makers and communication professionals.
   Recognizing the complexity of the science, the decisions, and the
   communication processes, the report calls for a systems approach. This
   perspective offers an approach to creating such systems by adapting
   scientific methods to the practical constraints of science
   communication. It considers staffing (are the right people involved?),
   internal collaboration (are they talking to one another?), and external
   collaboration (are they talking to other stakeholders?). It focuses on
   contexts where the goal of science communication is helping people to
   make autonomous choices rather than promoting specific behaviors (e.g.,
   voter turnout, vaccination rates, energy consumption). The approach is
   illustrated with research in two domains: decisions about preventing
   sexual assault and responding to pandemic disease.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of climate change requires a rethinking of existing
   socio-geographical arrangements. This paper argues that the transition
   to `post-fossil urbanization' is hampered by the lack of positive
   imaginations of alternative possible urban futures and post-fossil city
   life. It asks the question why it is so difficult to conceive of new
   possible urban worlds, and tries to answer it by using the established
   concept of `imaginary' and introducing the concept of `technique of
   futuring'. The salience of the imaginary of the modern city is used as
   an example. The paper points at the International Society for
   Organization (ISO) and `living labs' as contemporary techniques of
   futuring, organizing urban futures. It then aims to recoup one's
   capacity to imagine alternative possible worlds and explores the role
   that academics can play in this endeavour.}},

Abstract = {{Societal transformation is one of the most topical concepts in
   sustainability research and policy-making. Used in many ways, it
   indicates that nonlinear systematic changes are needed in order to fully
   address global environmental and human development challenges. This
   paper explores what sustainability transformations mean for lay focus
   group participants in Cabo Verde, China, Fiji, Sweden, and the USA. Key
   findings include: (a) Tightly linked to interpersonal relationships,
   sustainability was seen as going beyond the Sustainable Development
   Goals to include a sense of belonging; (b) transformations were framed
   as fundamental changes from today's society, but most participants
   stated that transformation pathways need to splice new structures into
   the old; (c) new technologies are key engines of change. Yet, the most
   common drivers were awareness, education, and knowledge sharing; and (d)
   regardless of whether state-centric or decentralized governance was
   preferred, personal action was seen as essential. The focus groups
   displayed a shared understanding across the geographical settings; a
   common realization of profound sustainability predicaments facing
   societies across the world; and a desire for fundamental change towards
   a more sustainable way of life.}},

Abstract = {{In this final paper, the guest editors identify and discuss ten
   guidelines emerging from the papers in this Special Issue on
   Decision-Support Tools for Climate Change Adaptation. The guidelines are
   arranged under three headings: foundational, design and construction,
   and supporting sustainability in the long term. Under foundational, we
   address the need for co-operation with end users of decision-support
   resources, the contribution these resources can make to the formation of
   thriving communities of practice, and the match between the different
   types of decision support and user needs. Under design and construction,
   we point to the risk that policy settings will change over the multiple
   years required to build and publish complex decision-support resources,
   reducing the relevance of the final product. We discuss the need for
   innovative approaches to ensure visibility, credibility and hence
   uptake. Developers should be mindful of the requirements, resources and
   capabilities of potential users at all points in the design and build.
   We also suggest that decision-support resources may be transferable
   between sectors and locations, but the motivation should be around
   achieving excellence, and not just cost savings. Under supporting
   sustainability in the long term, we stress the need for evaluation and
   comparative studies of performance, leading to carefully documented
   updating and improvement of decision-support resources. Finally, in the
   conclusions, we look to the future. Can decision-support resources
   evolve successfully to meet the information and guidance requirements of
   the increasingly sophisticated adaptation practitioner community?}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this synthesis paper is to present the motivations and
   conceptual basis for research on socio-technical-ecological systems
   (STES), addressing the need for interdisciplinary studies targeting the
   technological mediation of human-environment relationships. The
   background is the very limited number of collaborations between scholars
   of social-ecological systems and sociotechnical systems (SES), despite
   repeated calls for bridging work. The synthesis builds on an in-depth
   review of previous literature, interdisciplinary exchanges, and
   empirical examples. The result is arguments for why a sociotechnical
   understanding of technology' is of central importance for SES studies,
   related to how technology: (1) mediates human-environment relationships;
   (2) brings ambivalence to these relationships; (3) enhances and
   transforms human agency and provides a source of constitutive power; (4)
   changes scalar relationships, enabling our interaction with and impact
   on the natural world across time and space. Furthermore, we present an
   STES analytical approach which starts from symmetrical attention to
   technology, society, and environment, specifically targeting interfaces
   and relationships of critical relevance for SES scholars, and address
   counterarguments that we have encountered. We conclude that a shift to
   STES research will enhance our knowledge of system interfaces that are
   often overlooked, opening further avenues for research and real-world
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The current landscape of climate services represents a highly diverse
   and still growing range of programs, projects, and portals involved in
   developing and/or providing climate services at different administrative
   levels and spatial-temporal scales. The diversity of service producers,
   users, and policy arenas has created a highly heterogeneous data- and
   information-oriented service landscape, and the authors contend that the
   domain of climate services requires efforts toward agreed structures and
   forms of conceptualization, operationalization, and evaluation. It is
   proposed here that qualitative classification be applied into climate
   change adaptation products, services, and systems to better guide
   research, policy, and practice with a clear terminology and analysis
   framework. This differentiation allows the pinpointing of critical
   challenges associated with the production and application of
   climate-relevant information, as well as the identification of suitable
   metrics to assess the impact of climate services. The article concludes
   with recommendations to advance climate services into knowledge-action
   systems and increase their sustainability.}},

Title = {{The dark side of coproduction: do the costs outweigh the benefits for
   health research?}},
Journal = {{HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Coproduction, a collaborative model of research that
   includes stakeholders in the research process, has been widely advocated
   as a means of facilitating research use and impact. We summarise the
   arguments in favour of coproduction, the different approaches to
   establishing coproductive work and their costs, and offer some advice as
   to when and how to consider coproduction.
   Debate: Despite the multiplicity of reasons and incentives to coproduce,
   there is little consensus about what coproduction is, why we do it, what
   effects we are trying to achieve, or the best coproduction techniques to
   achieve policy, practice or population health change. Furthermore,
   coproduction is not free risk or cost. Tensions can arise throughout
   coproduced research processes between the different interests involved.
   We identify five types of costs associated with coproduced research
   affecting the research itself, the research process, professional risks
   for researchers and stakeholders, personal risks for researchers and
   stakeholders, and risks to the wider cause of scholarship. Yet, these
   costs are rarely referred to in the literature, which generally calls
   for greater inclusion of stakeholders in research processes, focusing
   exclusively on potential positives. There are few tools to help
   researchers avoid or alleviate risks to themselves and their
   stakeholders.
   Conclusions: First, we recommend identifying specific motivations for
   coproduction and clarifying exactly which outcomes are required for whom
   for any particular piece of research. Second, we suggest selecting
   strategies specifically designed to enable these outcomes to be
   achieved, and properly evaluated. Finally, in the absence of strong
   evidence about the impact and process of coproduction, we advise a
   cautious approach to coproduction. This would involve conscious and
   reflective research practice, evaluation of how coproduced research
   practices change outcomes, and exploration of the costs and benefits of
   coproduction. We propose some preliminary advice to help decide when
   coproduction is likely to be more or less useful.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining safe operating spaces for exploited natural systems in the
   face of uncertainty is a key sustainability challenge. This challenge
   can be viewed as a problem in which human society must navigate in a
   limited space of acceptable futures in which humans enjoy sufficient
   well-being and avoid crossing planetary boundaries. A critical obstacle
   is the nature of society as a controller with endogenous dynamics
   affected by knowledge, values, and decision-making fallacies. We outline
   an approach for analyzing the role of knowledge infrastructure in
   maintaining safe operating spaces. Using a classic natural resource
   problem as an illustration, we find that a small safe operating space
   exists that is insensitive to the type of policy implementation, while
   in general, a larger safe operating space exists which is dependent on
   the implementation of the ``right{''} policy. Our analysis suggests the
   importance of considering societal response dynamics to varying policy
   instruments in defining the shape of safe operating spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental and resource governance models emphasize the importance of
   local community and civil society participation to achieve social equity
   and environmental sustainability goals. Yet authoritarian political
   formations often undermine such participation through violent repression
   of dissent. This article seeks to advance understandings of violence
   against environmental and community activists challenging authoritarian
   forms of environmental and resource governance through eco-populist
   struggles. Authoritarianism and populism entertain complex
   relationships, including authoritarian practices toward and within
   eco-populist movements. Examining a major agrarian conflict and the
   killing of a prominent Indigenous leader in Honduras, we point to the
   frequent occurrence of deadly repression within societies experiencing
   high levels of inequalities, historical marginalization of Indigenous
   and peasant communities, a liberalization of foreign and private
   investments in land-based sectors, and recent reversals in partial
   democratization processes taking place within a broader context of high
   homicidal violence and impunity rates. We conclude with a discussion of
   the implications of deadly repression on environmental and land
   defenders.}},

Abstract = {{Natural resource management practices such as community-based resource
   management (CBRM) are well-established bottom-up approaches to
   developing adaptive governance systems. Less is understood about how
   communities involved in such processes can attract top-down support

   usefulness of the linked boundary functions concept - boundary chains -
   for explaining the role of ``research for development{''} (R4D)
   organizations in the integration of bottom-up community resource
   governance and top-down policy and legislative governance. We used the
   Australian Centre for Agricultural Research (ACIAR) in the Solomon
   Islands as a case study to probe the role of R4D organizations in this
   regard. The linked boundary functions concept proved useful in exploring
   the active functions of R4D organizations as actors that lend
   credibility, salience, and legitimacy to community-based governance
   initiatives. The concept of linked boundary functions or boundary chains
   can contribute to the current discussion in the complexity-aware theory
   of change and open new avenues for boundary management that enable the
   development of integrated resource governance in complex development
   contexts. This article contributes to the existing literature on the

Abstract = {{Recent high-level agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the
   Sustainable Development Goals aim at mitigating climate change,
   ecological degradation and biodiversity loss while pursuing social goals
   such as reducing hunger or poverty. Systemic approaches bridging natural
   and social sciences are required to support these agendas. The surging
   human use of biophysical resources (materials, energy) results from the
   pursuit of social and economic goals, while driving global environmental
   change. Sociometabolic research links the study of socioeconomic
   processes with biophysical processes and thus plays a pivotal role in
   understanding society-nature interactions. It includes a broad range of
   systems science approaches for measuring, analysing and modelling of
   biophysical stocks and flows as well as the services they provide to
   society. Here we outline and systematize major sociometabolic research
   traditions that study the biophysical basis of economic activity: urban
   metabolism, the multiscale integrated assessment of societal and
   ecosystem metabolism, biophysical economics, material and energy flow
   analysis, and environmentally extended input-output analysis. Examples
   from recent research demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of
   sociometabolic research. We discuss future research directions that
   could also help to enrich related fields.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Two of the most consequential developments affecting US politics are (1)
   the growing influence of private philanthropy, and (2) the large-scale
   production and diffusion of misinformation. Despite their importance,
   the links between these two trends have not been scientifically
   examined. This study employs a sophisticated research design on a large
   collection of new data, utilizing natural language processing and
   approximate string matching to examine the relationship between the
   large-scale climate misinformation movement and US philanthropy. The
   study finds that over a twenty year period, networks of actors
   promulgating scientific misinformation about climate change were
   increasingly integrated into the institution of US philanthropy. The
   degree of integration is predicted by funding ties to prominent
   corporate donors. These findings reveal new knowledge about large-scale
   efforts to distort public understanding of science and sow polarization.
   The study also contributes a unique computational approach to be applied
   at this increasingly important, yet methodologically fraught, area of
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural expansion remains the most prominent proximate cause of
   tropical deforestation in Latin America, a region characterized by
   deforestation rates substantially above the world average and extremely
   high inequality. This paper deploys several multivariate statistical
   models to test whether different aspects of inequality, within a context
   of increasing agricultural productivity, promote agricultural expansion
   (Jevons paradox) or contraction (land-sparing) in 10 Latin American
   countries over 1990-2010. Here I show the existence of distinct patterns
   between the instantaneous and the overall (i.e., accounting for temporal
   lags) effect of increasing agricultural productivity, conditional on the
   degree of income, land, and wealth inequality. In a context of perfect
   equality, the instantaneous effect of increases in agricultural
   productivity is to promote agricultural expansion (Jevons paradox). When
   temporal lags are accounted for, agricultural productivity appears to be
   mainly land-sparing. Increases in the level of inequality, in all its
   forms, promote agricultural expansion, thus eroding the land-sparing
   effects of increasing productivity. The results also suggest that the
   instantaneous impact of inequality is larger than the overall effect
   (accounting for temporal lags) and that the effects of income inequality
   are stronger than those of land and wealth inequality, respectively.
   Reaping the benefits of increasing agricultural productivity, and
   achieving sustainable agricultural intensification in Latin America,
   requires policy interventions that specifically address inequality.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural insights are becoming increasingly popular with policy
   practitioners. Findings and methods originally provided by cognitive
   psychology and later behavioural economics have found use in the
   formulation of public policies. Their most popularised application has
   emerged under the auspices of libertarian paternalism in the form of
   `nudging'. Its proponents claim to provide a new instrument to
   facilitate the formulation of effective and evidence-based policy,
   taking people's actual behaviour into account from the outset, while
   preserving their liberty to choose. This article reviews the origins of
   libertarian paternalism and the behavioural insights it builds on and
   takes a critical look at the foundations nudging relies on as a policy
   tool. It also discusses the ongoing efforts to build policy capacity to
   integrate behavioural insights and experimental methods in the creation
   of public policy. Behavioural insights offer a powerful tool to reshape
   and design new evidence-based policy. However, designers ought to be
   aware of the underlying assumptions on individual behaviour, the
   broadness of the mandate the nudging approach claims and the challenges
   they pose for design effectiveness.}},

Journal = {{POLICY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{118-147}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{A growing scholarship on multistakeholder learning dialogues suggests
   the importance of closely managing learning processes to help
   stakeholders anticipate which policies are likely to be effective. Much
   less work has focused on how to manage effective transnational
   multistakeholder learning dialogues, many of which aim to help address
   critical global environmental and social problems such as climate change
   or biodiversity loss. They face three central challenges. First, they
   rarely shape policies and behaviors directly, but work to `nudge' or
   `tip the scales' in domestic settings. Second, they run the risk of
   generating `compromise' approaches incapable of ameliorating the
   original problem definition for which the dialogue was created. Third,
   they run the risk of being overly influenced, or captured, by powerful
   interests whose rationale for participating is to shift problem
   definitions or narrow instrument choices to those innocuous to their
   organizational or individual interests. Drawing on policy learning
   scholarship, we identify a six-stage learning process for anticipating
   effectiveness designed to minimize these risks while simultaneously
   fostering innovative approaches for meaningful and longlasting problem
   solving: Problem definition assessments; Problem framing; Developing
   coalition membership; Causal framework development; Scoping exercises;
   Knowledge institutionalization. We also identify six management
   techniques within each process for engaging transnational dialogues
   around problem solving. We show that doing so almost always requires
   anticipating multiple-step causal pathways through which influence of
   transnational and/or international actors and institutions might occur.}},

   Environmental Innovation}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{As a purposive sustainability transition requires environmental
   innovation and innovation policy, we discuss potentials and limitations
   of three dominant strands of literature in this field, namely the
   multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP), the
   innovation systems approach (IS), and the long-wave theory of
   techno-economic paradigm shifts (LWT). All three are epistemologically
   rooted in an evolutionary understanding of socio-technical change. While
   these approaches are appropriate to understand market-driven processes
   of change, they may be deficient as analytical tools for exploring and
   designing processes of purposive societal transformation. In particular,
   we argue that the evolutionary mechanism of selection is the key to
   introducing the strong directionality required for purposive
   transformative change. In all three innovation theories, we find that
   the prime selection environment is constituted by the market and, thus,
   normative societal goals like sustainability are sidelined.
   Consequently, selection is depoliticised and neither strong
   directionality nor incumbent regime destabilisation are societally
   steered. Finally, we offer an analytical framework that builds upon a
   more political conception of selection and retention and calls for new
   political institutions to make normatively guided selections.
   Institutions for transformative innovation need to improve the
   capacities of complex societies to make binding decisions in politically
   contested fields.}},

Title = {{Critical Commons Scholarship: A Typology}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1112-1127}},
Abstract = {{Common-pool resource theory (CPR theory) emerged to understand the
   limitations of the tragedy of the commons narrative, and the theory of
   human behavior underlying it. Over time, diverse critiques of CPR theory
   have also emerged. Prominent critiques include inattention to power and
   coercion, assumptions that institutions can be crafted, and analyses
   that exclude history and context, among others. We label this literature
   critical commons scholarship. In this review paper, we define a typology
   of five types of critical commons scholarship. The functionalist
   critique (type 1) argues that a narrow focus on institutions that
   excludes history, context, and contingencies causes erroneous
   conclusions about the causes of resource sustainability. The apolitical
   management critique (type 2) argues that a focus on resource
   sustainability causes commons scholars to ignore how power is used to
   create and maintain inequalities through rules and norms structuring
   resource access. The methodological critique (type 3) argues that
   methodological incompatibilities, such as CPR theory's dependence on
   general, abstract models, necessarily prevent these scholars from
   responding to type 1 and type 2 critiques. The project of government
   critique (type 4) argues that common-pool resource theory is used to
   support neoliberal and hegemonic practices. Finally, the ethical
   critique (type 5) argues that common-pool resource theory is premised on
   problematic north-south relationships where expert scholars in the
   global north provide information to be consumed by ``commoners{''} in
   the global south. Mainstream CPR theory has been limited in engaging
   with critical commons scholarship, but there are new tools (such as the
   social-ecological systems framework and the critical institutionalism
   approach) for addressing each type of critique. Our goal in developing
   this typology is to make critiques of CPR theory legible and potentially
   actionable, while acknowledging the challenges associated with
   addressing them.}},

Abstract = {{Co-production has become a cornerstone of research within the
   sustainability sciences, motivating collaborations of diverse actors to
   conduct research in the service of societal and policy change. This
   review examines theoretical and empirical literature from sustainability
   science, public administration, and science and technology studies (STS)
   with the intention of advancing the theory and practice of co-production
   within sustainability science. We argue that co-production must go
   beyond stakeholder engagement by scientists to the more deliberate
   design of societal transitions. Co-production can contribute to such
   transitions by shifting the institutional arrangements that govern
   relationships between knowledge and power, science and society, and
   state and citizens. We highlight critical weaknesses in
   conceptualizations of co-production within sustainability sciences with
   respect to power, politics, and governance. We offer suggestions for how
   this can be rectified through deeper engagement with public
   administration and STS to offer a broad vision for enhancing the use,
   design, and practice of a more reflexive co-production in sustainability
   science.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional top-down methods for resource management ask first what
   future conditions will be, then identify the best action(s) to take in
   response to that prediction. Even when acknowledging uncertainty about
   the future, standard approaches (a) characterize uncertainties
   probabilistically, then optimize objectives in expectation, and/or (b)
   develop a small number of representative scenarios to explore variation
   in outcomes under different policy responses. This leaves planners
   vulnerable to surprise if future conditions diverge from predictions. In
   this review, we describe contemporary approaches to decision support
   that address deep uncertainty about future external forcings, system
   responses, and stakeholder preferences for different outcomes. Many of
   these methods are motivated by climate change adaptation, infrastructure
   planning, or natural resources management, and they provide dramatic
   improvements in the robustness of management strategies. We outline
   various methods conceptually and describe how they have been applied in
   a range of landmark real-world planning studies.}},

   review recent research on movements' impacts on public opinion and
   everyday behavior; the media and popular culture; nonpolitical
   institutions such as science, medicine, and education; and politics. We
   focus on cultural impacts that have mattered for movements'
   constituencies and address why movements have had those impacts. We
   conclude with an agenda for future research, seeking greater connection

Abstract = {{This article reviews the recent literature on the dynamics of global
   wealth inequality. I first reconcile available estimates of wealth
   inequality in the United States. Both surveys and tax data show that
   wealth inequality has increased dramatically since the 1980s, with a top
   1\% wealth share of approximately 40\% in 2016 versus 25-30\% in the
   1980s. Second, I discuss the fast-growing literature on wealth
   inequality across the world. Evidence points toward a rise in global
   wealth concentration: For China, Europe, and the United States combined,
   the top 1\% wealth share has increased from 28\% in 1980 to 33\% today,
   while the bottom 75\% share hovered around 10\%. Recent studies,
   however, may underestimate the level and rise of inequality, as
   financial globalization makes it increasingly hard to measure wealth at
   the top. I discuss how new data sources (leaks from financial
   institutions, tax amnesties, and macroeconomic statistics of tax havens)
   can be leveraged to better capture the wealth of the rich.}},

Abstract = {{In the study of common-pool resource (CPR) governance, frameworks
   provide a metatheoretical language to describe system states, dynamics,
   elements, and relationships. The coding manuals which accompany CPR
   frame-works-in addition to providing guidelines for connecting empirical
   case work to conceptual variables-define a vocabulary of coding
   questions. For empirical work, connecting variables and coding questions
   with framework elements contributes to conceptual advance. In the
   process of analysis and publication, it is tempting to offer a novel
   framework without also developing, applying, or modifying the
   foundational questions and variables of coding manuals buttressing said
   frameworks. However, if the scholarly community is to generate robust
   knowledge for the study of CPR dilemmas, we must provide the underlying
   work of comparing across frameworks. In this paper, we report on one way
   the community might conduct such comparisons. We present results and
   challenges of using a group consensus process to link the more than 450
   coding questions derived from the original Institutional Analysis and
   Development Framework (IADF) to the recently proposed Coupled
   Infrastructure Systems Framework (CISF). Despite overlap, discrepancies
   in the conceptual positions of the IADF and CISF suggest a need to
   modify or create new coding variables related to concepts of system
   boundaries, externalities, cross-scale interactions,
   multi-functionality, and technological change. We suggest that such work
   needs provisioning if commons scholars are to navigate the continued
   challenges of tailoring frameworks and coding manuals to evolving CPR
   governance dilemmas.}},

   the boundaries for a safe planet(1). Social scientists both analyse why
   society courts disaster by approaching or even overstepping these
   boundaries and try to design suitable policies to avoid these perils.
   Because the threats of transgressing planetary boundaries are global,
   long-run, uncertain and interconnected, they must be analysed together
   to avoid conflicts and take advantage of synergies. To obtain policies
   that are effective at both international and local levels requires
   careful analysis of the underlying mechanisms across scientific
   disciplines and approaches, and must take politics into account. In this
   Perspective, we examine the complexities of designing policies that can
   keep Earth within the biophysical limits favourable to human life.}},

Abstract = {{Regime shifts are large, abrupt, and persistent critical transitions in
   the function and structure of ecosystems. Yet, it is unknown how these
   transitions will interact, whether the occurrence of one will increase
   the likelihood of another or simply correlate at distant places. We
   explored two types of cascading effects: Domino effects create one-way
   dependencies, whereas hidden feedbacks produce two-way interactions. We
   compare them with the control case of driver sharing, which can induce
   correlations. Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that
   45\% of regime shift pairwise combinations present at least one
   plausible structural interdependence. The likelihood of cascading
   effects depends on cross-scale interactions but differs for each type.
   Management of regime shifts should account for potential connections.}},

Abstract = {{Current theoretical models of the commons assert that common-pool
   resources can only be managed sustainably with clearly defined
   boundaries around both communities and the resources that they use. In
   these theoretical models, open access inevitably leads to a tragedy of
   the commons. However, in many open access systems, use of common-pool
   resources seems to be sustainable over the long term (i.e., current
   resource use does not threaten use of common-pool resources for future
   generations). Here, we outline the conditions that support sustainable
   resource use in open property regimes. We use the conceptual framework
   of complex adaptive systems to explain how processes within and
   couplings between human and natural systems can lead to the emergence of
   efficient, equitable, and sustainable resource use. We illustrate these
   dynamics in eight case studies of different social-ecological systems,
   including mobile pastoralism, marine and freshwater fisheries, swidden
   agriculture, and desert foraging. Our theoretical framework identifies
   eight conditions that are critical for the emergence of sustainable use
   of common-pool resources in open property regimes. In addition, we
   explain how changes in boundary conditions may push open property
   regimes to either common property regimes or a tragedy of the commons.
   Our theoretical model of emergent sustainability helps us to understand
   the diversity and dynamics of property regimes across a wide range of
   social-ecological systems and explains the enigma of open access without
   a tragedy. We recommend that policy interventions in such
   self-organizing systems should focus on managing the conditions that are
   critical for the emergence and persistence of sustainability.}},

   terms of a `nexus', which is perhaps at risk of becoming a buzz word. A
   nexus between what? Over what scales? And what are the consequences of
   such a nexus? This article analyses why readers should care about the
   nexus concept in relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development

   perspectives that may lead to a reload of climate policy with buy-in

Volume = {{151}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{525-539}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing concern that avoiding climate change impacts will
   require proactive adaptation, particularly for infrastructure systems
   with long lifespans. However, one challenge in adaptation is the
   uncertainty surrounding climate change projections generated by general
   circulation models (GCMs). This uncertainty has been addressed in
   different ways. For example, some researchers use ensembles of GCMs to
   generate probabilistic climate change projections, but these projections
   can be highly sensitive to assumptions about model independence and
   weighting schemes. Because of these issues, others argue that
   robustness-based approaches to climate adaptation are more appropriate,
   since they do not rely on a precise probabilistic representation of
   uncertainty. In this research, we present a new approach for
   characterizing climate change risks that leverages robust decision
   frameworks and probabilistic GCM ensembles. The scenario discovery
   process is used to search across a multi-dimensional space and identify
   climate scenarios most associated with system failure, and a Bayesian
   statistical model informed by GCM projections is then developed to
   estimate the probability of those scenarios. This provides an important
   advancement in that it can incorporate decision-relevant climate
   variables beyond mean temperature and precipitation and account for
   uncertainty in probabilistic estimates in a straightforward way. We also
   suggest several advancements building on prior approaches to Bayesian
   modeling of climate change projections to make them more broadly
   applicable. We demonstrate the methodology using proposed water
   resources infrastructure in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, where GCM disagreement
   on changes in future rainfall presents a major challenge for
   infrastructure planning.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to improve the
   lives of people, increase prosperity, and protect the planet. Given the
   large number of goals, interactions are inevitable. We analyse the
   interaction between two social goals (related to SDG1 Poverty and SDG10
   Inequality) and three environmental goals (related to SDG13 Carbon,
   SDG15 Land, and SDG6 Water). We use a trade-linked, consumption-based
   approach to assess interactions in 166 nations, each subdivided into
   four income groups. We find that pursuing social goals is, generally,
   associated with higher environmental impacts. However, interactions
   differ greatly among countries and depend on the specific goals. In both
   interactions, carbon experiences smaller changes than land and water.
   Although efforts by high- and low-income groups are needed, the rich
   have a greater leverage to reduce humanity's footprints. Given the
   importance of both social and environmental sustainability, it is
   crucial that quantitative interactions between SDGs be well understood
   so that, where needed, integrative policies can be developed.}},

Abstract = {{Invariably, across a cross-section of countries and time periods, wealth
   distributions are skewed to the right displaying thick upper tails, that
   is, large and slowly declining top wealth shares. In this survey, we
   categorize the theoretical studies on the distribution of wealth in
   terms of the underlying economic mechanisms generating skewness and
   thick tails. Further, we show how these mechanisms can be micro-founded
   by the consumption-savings decisions of rational agents in specific
   economic and demographic environments. Finally we map the large
   empirical work on the wealth distribution to its theoretical
   underpinnings.}},

   essential for managing the health of humans and their livestock. It has
   long been difficult to quantify resilience directly, forcing
   practitioners to rely on indirect static indicators of health. However,
   measurements from wearable electronics and other sources now allow us to
   analyze the dynamics of physiology and behavior with unsurpassed
   resolution. The resulting flood of data coincides with the emergence of
   novel analytical tools for estimating resilience from the pattern of
   microrecoveries observed in natural time series. Such dynamic indicators
   of resilience may be used to monitor the risk of systemic failure across
   systems ranging from organs to entire organisms. These tools invite a
   fundamental rethinking of our approach to the adaptive management of
   health and resilience.}},

Title = {{Middle-range theories of land system change}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{52-67}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Changes in land systems generate many sustainability challenges.
   Identifying more sustainable land-use alternatives requires solid
   theoretical foundations on the causes of land-use/cover changes. Land
   system science is a maturing field that has produced a wealth of
   methodological innovations and empirical observations on land cover and
   land-use change, from patterns and processes to causes. We take stock of
   this knowledge by reviewing and synthesizing the theories that explain
   the causal mechanisms of land-use change, including systemic linkages
   between distant land-use changes, with a focus on agriculture and
   forestry processes. We first review theories explaining changes in
   land-use extent, such as agricultural expansion, deforestation, frontier
   development, and land abandonment, and changes in land-use intensity,
   such as agricultural intensification and disintensification. We then
   synthesize theories of higher-level land system change processes,
   focusing on: (i) land-use spillovers, including land sparing and rebound
   effects with intensification, leakage, indirect land-use change, and
   land-use displacement, and (ii) land-use transitions, defined as
   structural non-linear changes in land systems, including forest
   transitions. Theories focusing on the causes of land system changes span
   theoretically and epistemologically disparate knowledge domains and
   build from deductive, abductive, and inductive approaches. A grand,
   integrated theory of land system change remains elusive. Yet, we show
   that middle-range theories - defined here as contextual generalizations
   that describe chains of causal mechanisms explaining a well-bounded
   range of phenomena, as well as the conditions that trigger, enable, or
   prevent these causal chains -, provide a path towards generalized
   knowledge of land systems. This knowledge can support progress towards
   sustainable social-ecological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent
   framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are
   identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy
   discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a
   Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science
   and R\&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and
   address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second
   frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on
   competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation
   for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on
   building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning
   between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third
   frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as
   the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change
   is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames.
   Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised
   in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third
   framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its
   potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One
   key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the
   Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation
   model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are
   relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative
   innovation policy should be a priority.}},

Abstract = {{The topics addressed in this paper concern the (much-needed) transition
   to sustainability and what role (innovation) policy can play in speeding
   up such changes. In their Discussion Paper Schot and Steinmueller (2018)
   argue that the existing theorizing and knowledge bases within the field
   of innovation studies are ``unfit{''} for this task and that a totally
   new approach is required. This paper takes issue with this claim. Policy
   advice, it is argued, needs to be anchored in the accumulated research
   on the issue at hand, in this case, innovation. The paper therefore
   starts by distilling some important insights on innovation from the
   accumulated research on this topic and, with this in mind, considers
   various policy approaches that have been suggested for influencing
   innovation and sustainability transitions. Finally, the lessons for the
   development and implementation of transformative innovation policy are
   considered. It is concluded that the existing theorizing and knowledge
   base in innovation studies may be of great relevance when designing
   policies for dealing with climate change and sustainability transitions.}},

Abstract = {{This article contextualizes the reemergence of mission-oriented
   innovation policies in the broader search for a new type of innovation
   policies-and the appropriate organizational forms-that can tackle
   ``grand societal challenges,{''} and focuses on our knowledge gaps in
   designing and implementing such innovation policies. We identify the
   concept and practice of dynamic capabilities in the public sector as
   perhaps the key missing element in the search for the new generation of
   innovation policies. We offer a brief conceptual and historical overview
   of what constitutes mission-oriented policies, focusing on two key
   elements of missions: coordinated public investments and market-shaping
   policies to ``crowd in{''} private and third sector experimentation and
   innovation. The article concludes by briefly discussing the central
   public sector dynamic capabilities for 21st-century missions.}},

Title = {{The control versus resilience rationale for managing systems under
   uncertainty}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We compare two rationales for the management of social-ecological
   systems under uncertainty: control and resilience. The first focuses at
   system performance, the second at system capacity to cope with change.
   The two schools of thought promote their own legitimacy, but undertake
   little effort to transcend their own perspective. Though, different
   scholars have pointed at the necessity of combining control and
   resilience for managing a system. We review the literature on control
   and resilience, synthesize the work in these fields into one coherent
   conceptual framework and reflect on the question whether control and
   resilience strategies can be reconciled or whether inevitable trade-offs
   are to be made. Based on a literature review, we develop a framework
   contrasting both rationales through their preferred (contrary) system
   attributes. Next, we discuss the operationalization of these system
   properties for policy development. Policies will generally reflect
   elements of both control and resilience. There will be trade-offs
   between preferred system attributes, where development of resilience
   restricts the development of possible control (and vice versa). The
   conceptual framework introduced provides a `language' for contrasting
   and possibly (partly) reconciling the control and resilience rationales.
   Such a language is crucial for a meaningful policy discourse between
   actors, because it helps in understanding the implications of different
   rationales and in comparing alternative policies in terms of control and
   resilience.}},

Title = {{Politicising inequality: The power of ideas}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{360-372}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A contemporary challenge is inequality. This paper illustrates why ideas
   matter, and how they can change over time. Inequalities are reinforced
   when they are taken for granted. But this can be disrupted when
   marginalised people gain self-esteem; challenge hitherto unquestioned
   inequalities; and gain confidence in the possibility of social change.
   Slowly and incrementally, social mobilisation can catalyse greater
   government commitment to socially inclusive economic growth. This is
   illustrated with ethnographic research from Latin America, where income
   inequality has recently declined. Clearly, however, no single paper can
   provide a comprehensive account of political change in an incredibly
   diverse region. By highlighting some ways in which ideas matter (and the
   limitations of alternative hypotheses about increased fiscal space and
   democratisation), this paper merely seeks to persuade political
   economists to go beyond `incentives'. Future efforts to tackle
   inequality might harness the power of ideas: tackling `norm perceptions'
   (beliefs about what others think and do); publicising positive deviance;
   and strengthening social movements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In acknowledgement of the complexity of environmental challenges,
   research on learning in environmental policy has grown substantially

   providing insights on the overall coherence and impact of this body of

   2014 using a standardized coding framework. The results provide an
   in-depth assessment of the status of the literature on learning in the
   context of environmental policy, as well as the quality of the
   literature. We demonstrate that despite the diversity in research
   questions and goals, the literature is lacking with respect to diversity
   in cases and context, theoretical development, clear conceptualization
   and operationalization of learning, and advancements in empirical
   approaches to study learning. From these insights, we discuss the
   challenges and opportunities for scholars in studying learning and
   provide recommendations for building the theoretical and methodological

Abstract = {{We explore the risk that self-reinforcing feedbacks could push the Earth
   System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent
   stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature rises and cause
   continued warming on a ``Hothouse Earth{''} pathway even as human
   emissions are reduced. Crossing the threshold would lead to a much
   higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2
   million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in
   the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist
   and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting
   trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems,
   society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the
   Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a
   habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of
   the entire Earth System-biosphere, climate, and societies-and could
   include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere
   carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new
   governance arrangements, and transformed social values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the socio-technical imaginaries surrounding
   infrastructures of coal mining and coal combustion in Poland.
   Contemporary policy makers in Poland mobilise a national imaginary
   inherited from communist times - encapsulated in the slogan `Poland
   stands on coal' - that fuses infrastructures of coal extraction and
   combustion with the fate of the nation. This socio-technical imaginary
   provides support for coal futures, even in the face of contradictory
   evidence for domestic resource depletion, poor regional air quality, and
   global climate change. To examine this process, the paper brings
   research on socio-technical imaginaries into conversation with work on
   resource materialities. It highlights how certain materialities of coal
   (abundance, accessibility, energy density, location) were integral to
   the emergence of a national socio-technical imaginary of modernisation
   via coal; and how other materialities (declining resource quality,
   effects of emissions on respiratory health, coal as CO2-in-waiting) now
   collide with the political strategies of a government determined to
   reassert `black gold' as a bedrock of national development for years to
   come. The paper considers how contemporary political efforts to
   rehabilitate coal and secure its future in Poland draw selectively upon
   a sociotechnical imaginary of coal-fuelled national modernisation.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial society has not only led to high levels of wealth and welfare
   in the Western world, but also to increasing global ecological
   degradation and social inequality. The socio-technical systems that
   underlay contemporary societies have substantially contributed to these
   outcomes. This paper proposes that these sociotechnical systems are an
   expression of a limited number of meta-rules that, for the past 250
   years, have driven innovation and hence system evolution in a particular
   direction, thereby constituting the First Deep Transition. Meeting the
   cumulative social and ecological consequences of the overall direction
   of the First Deep Transition would require a radical change, not only in
   socio-technical systems but also in the meta-rules driving their
   evolution - the Second Deep Transition. This paper develops a new
   theoretical framework that aims to explain the emergence, acceleration,
   stabilization and directionality of Deep Transitions. It does so through
   the synthesis of two literatures that have attempted to explain
   large-scale and long-term socio-technical change: the Multilevel
   Perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, and Techno-economic
   Paradigm (TEP) framework.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{177-189}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study develops research on social movements, political coalitions,
   and sustainability transitions with a multi-coalition perspective. The
   perspective begins with a typology of coalitions based on two pairs of
   goals-general societal change versus the sociotechnical transition of an
   industry or technological system, and sunrising versus sunsetting of
   systems and structures. Mapping the diversity of energy-transition
   coalitions makes it possible not only to identify the various wings of a
   broader industrial transition movement in a specified time and place but
   also to show the dynamics of how coalitions interact and change over
   time. Drawing on case studies of four energy-transition coalitions in
   New York State that approximate the four ideal types, the study shows
   differences in the goals, strategies, organizational composition, and
   frames of the coalitions. The study then shows the mechanisms that
   enable integration across coalitions, including the role of bridge
   brokers and new frames. As the networks of the energy-transition
   coalitions become more connected, the organizations make use of a wider
   set of frames, including the newer frame of energy democracy. Thus, the
   study develops an approach to the study of energy democracy that shows
   how it can serve as a frame that bridge brokers use to integrate
   coalitions.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH POLICY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{735-749}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow
   similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the
   relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly
   between different regions and countries. It takes a critical stance on
   the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies'
   socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative `global'
   regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor
   networks and institutional rationalities, which influence transition
   dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on
   globalization theories from sociology and human geography, we show that
   socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that
   are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in
   various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the
   multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in
   socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the
   conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this
   with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese
   wastewater sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on
   wastewater infrastructure expansion were not only influenced by
   path-dependencies stemming from China's national context, but equally
   (or even more critically) by the dominant rationality of the water
   sector's global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the
   contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global
   socio-technical regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The term tipping point has experienced explosive popularity across
   multiple disciplines over the last decade. Research on social-ecological
   systems (SES) has contributed to the growth and diversity of the term's
   use. The diverse uses of the term obscure potential differences between
   tipping behavior in natural and social systems, and issues of causality
   across natural and social system components in SES. This paper aims to
   create the foundation for a discussion within the SES research community
   about the appropriate use of the term tipping point, especially the
   relatively novel term `social tipping point.' We review existing
   literature on tipping points and similar concepts (e.g. regime shifts,
   critical transitions) across all spheres of science published between
   1960 and 2016 with a special focus on a recent and still small body of
   work on social tipping points. We combine quantitative and qualitative
   analyses in a bibliometric approach, rooted in an expert elicitation
   process. We find that the term tipping point became popular after the
   year 2000-long after the terms regime shift and critical
   transition-across all spheres of science. We identify 23 distinct
   features of tipping point definitions and their prevalence across
   disciplines, but find no clear taxonomy of discipline-specific
   definitions. Building on the most frequently used features, we propose
   definitions for tipping points in general and social tipping points in
   SES in particular.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The past decade has witnessed a resurgence in innovation awards, in
   particular of grand innovation prizes (GIPs) which are rewards to
   innovators developing technologies reaching performance goals and
   requiring breakthrough solutions. GIPs typically do not preclude the
   winner also obtaining patent rights. This is in stark contrast with
   mainstream economics of innovation theories where prizes and patents are
   substitute ways to generate revenue and encourage innovation. Building
   on the management of innovation literature which stresses the difficulty
   to specify ex-ante all the technical features of the winning
   technologies, we develop a model in which innovative effort is
   multi-dimensional and only a subset of innovation tasks can be measured
   and contracted upon. We show that in this environment patent rights and
   cash rewards are complements, and that GIPS are often preferable to
   patent races or prizes requiring technologies to be placed in the public
   domain. Moreover, our model uncovers a tendency for patent races to
   encourage speed of discovery over quality of innovation, which can be
   corrected by GIPs. We explore robustness to endogenous entry, costly
   public funds, and incomplete information by GIP organizers on the
   surplus created by the technology.}},

Title = {{Telecoupling: A new frontier for global sustainability}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Telecoupling refers to socioeconomic and environmental interactions
   between distant coupled human and natural systems, and has become more
   extensive and intensive in the globalized era. The integrated framework
   of telecoupling examines flows of information, energy, matter, people,
   organisms, and other things such as financial capital and goods and
   products around the globe. It pinpoints causes and effects arising from
   engagement of diverse agents in the global sphere. This first special
   feature on telecoupling includes 16 articles that explore diverse
   telecouplings including trade, migration, tourism, information exchange,
   and transnational product certification schemes. Here we synthesize the
   articles by describing eight overarching lessons learned. These include
   the impact of physical, social, and institutional distance on
   telecouplings, key roles of agents and their inter-relationships, and
   the important function of telecoupling in enhancing information signals
   over long distances. Several lessons directly apply to global
   sustainability challenges, such as the importance of recognizing
   trade-offs between local and global sustainability and the need for
   multi-level management and governance solutions. We also suggest five
   areas of future research to help propel this nascent field forward and
   further cement its applicability to addressing global sustainability
   challenges.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Transformations toward sustainability have recently gained traction,
   triggered in part by a growing recognition of the dramatic
   socio-cultural, political, economic, and technological changes required
   to move societies toward more desirable futures in the Anthropocene.
   However, there is a dearth of literature that emphasizes the crucial
   aspects of sustainability transformations in the diverse contexts of the
   Global South. Contributors to this Special Feature aim to address this
   gap by weaving together a series of case studies that together form an
   important navigational tool on the ``how to{''} as well as the
   ``what{''} and the ``where to{''} of sustainability transformations
   across diverse challenges, sectors, and geographies. They propose the
   term ``transformative space{''} as a ``safe-enough{''} collaborative
   process whereby actors invested in sustainability transformations can
   experiment with new mental models, ideas, and practices that can help
   shift social-ecological systems onto more desirable pathways. The
   authors also highlight the challenges posed to researchers as they
   become ``transformative space-makers,{''} navigating the power dynamics
   inherent in these processes. Because researchers and practitioners alike
   are challenged to provide answers to complex and often ambiguous or
   incomplete questions around sustainability, the ideas, reflections and
   learning gathered in this Special Feature provide some guidance on new
   ways of engaging with the world.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The study of social-ecological systems (SES) has been significantly
   shaped by insights from research on complex adaptive systems (CAS). We
   offer a brief overview of the conceptual integration of CAS research and
   its implications for the advancement of SES studies and methods. We
   propose a conceptual typology of six organizing principles of CAS based
   on a comparison of leading scholars' classifications of CAS features and
   properties. This typology clusters together similar underlying
   organizing principles of the features and attributes of CAS, and serves
   as a heuristic framework for identifying methods and approaches that
   account for the key features of SES. These principles can help identify
   appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three
   main implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there
   needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions
   in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that
   characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the
   intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences
   for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and
   studying SES interactions. Third, engagement with SES as CAS poses
   normative challenges for problem-oriented researchers and practitioners
   taking on real-world challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Social-ecological systems (SES) research offers new theory and evidence
   to transform sustainable development to better contend with the
   challenges of the Anthropocene. Four insights from contemporary SES
   literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c)
   systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored.
   Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are
   suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social
   and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential
   susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is
   highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities
   required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable
   development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and
   beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between
   social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to
   support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these
   perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel

Abstract = {{New partnerships between governments, private companies, and
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are reshaping global environmental
   governance. In particular, there has been a rise of voluntary
   sustainability standards in an attempt to manage social and
   environmental impacts of global supply chains. We analyze the large
   spectrum of interactions between private, public, and civil society
   actors around voluntary sustainability standards, primarily for tropical
   agriculture and forestry. This review uncovers a policy ecosystem
   dominated by a proliferation of standards that complement, substitute,
   or compete against each other, with coordination mechanisms beginning to
   arise. Contrary to widely held views, interactions between governments,
   NGOs, and private companies surrounding the adoption of sustainable
   practices are not generally antagonistic, and public and private
   environmental governance regimes rarely operate independently. The
   influence of these interactions on the effectiveness of sustainability
   standards needs more attention. Better understanding how private
   regulations interact with the policy ecosystem will help design more
   effective interventions.}},

   shows the importance of clearly formulated questions, structured dialog,

Title = {{The Regime Shifts Database: a framework for analyzing regime shifts in
   social-ecological systems}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes
   in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on
   ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the
   vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely
   unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different
   ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven.
   Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather
   than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for
   identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime
   shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an
   open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on
   social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a
   consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information
   resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching
   initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime
   shifts and > 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a
   literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying
   the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human
   well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime
   shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most
   prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and
   aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects
   of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an
   array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will
   stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform
   policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to
   manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.}},

Title = {{Reframing the sustainable development goals to achieve sustainable
   development in the Anthropocene-a systems approach}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Griggs et al. (2013) redefine sustainable development as ``development
   that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding Earth's
   life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future
   generations depend.{''} We recommend this as the end goal that the
   United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) should strive to
   achieve. Integration across the SDGs is less than what is required from
   a science perspective. Effective implementation of the SDGs will require
   States to attend to trade-offs and overlaps. We argue that continuous
   failure to address integration within the SDGs will jeopardize
   realization of this ultimate end goal. Therefore, we adopt a systems
   approach to identify gaps and connections across the goals and targets
   of the SDGs as well as leverage points for effective intervention. We
   triangulate across methods of critical analysis, conceptual modeling,
   and keyword network analysis to draw out seven ``overarching
   directions{''} that could provide a prioritization framework to enhance
   efficient implementation of the SDGs. Our results identify main gaps as
   exclusion of key actors (e.g., corporations) and issues (e.g.,
   intergenerational equity and population); inadequate reconciliation of
   economic growth with maintaining the Earth system; and deficient
   consideration of the relationship with international law. Conceptual
   mapping identifies education and innovation; governance and
   implementation; sustainable consumption and production; and addressing
   the key drivers of climate change as key leverage points. The keyword
   analysis highlights greater integration within the SDGs than what
   appears at face value. Keywords ``access,{''} ``women,{''}
   ``resources,{''}and ``finance{''} feature across the SDGs and provide
   further leverage points. Targeting these issues will facilitate
   realization of a high proportion of SDGs and correspondingly could have
   a disproportional impact on effective SDG implementation. We conclude
   that the success of the SDGs needs to be evaluated by the extent to
   which it contributes to human development while advancing protection of
   ``planetary must-haves{''} for current and future generations.}},

Abstract = {{Learning is considered as a promising mechanism to cope with rapid
   environmental change. The implications of learning for natural resource
   management (NRM) have not been explored in-depth and the evidence on the
   topic is scattered across multiple sources. We provide a qualitative
   review of types of learning outcomes and consider their manifestations
   in NRM across selected empirical literature. We conducted a systematic
   search of the peer-reviewed literature (N = 1,223) and a qualitative
   meta-synthesis of included articles, with an explicit focus on learning
   outcomes and NRM changes (N = 53). Besides social learning, we found
   several learning concepts used, including policy and transformative
   learning, and multiple links between learning and NRM reported. We
   observe that the development of skills, together with a system approach
   involving multi-level capacities, is decisive for implications of
   learning for NRM. Future reviews could systematically compare how
   primary research applies different learning concepts and discusses links
   between learning and NRM changes.}},

Abstract = {{We explore how large incumbent organisations shape emerging
   technological fields while establishing a position and business
   opportunities for themselves during technological shifts. We draw from
   innovation studies that increasingly emphasise the ability of incumbent
   organisations to survive technological transformations and studies on
   emerging technological fields to identify ways in which incumbent
   organisations shape novel fields during their emergence. Through
   longitudinal case studies of two emerging fields, we examine how
   incumbents shape the emerging technological fields of solar energy and
   electric vehicles. We discuss the interlinked and cumulative business
   and discursive activities utilized by the incumbents as well as the
   mechanism through which they influence the legitimacy, expectations and
   field boundaries of the emerging technological fields. Our study draws
   attention to the fact that incumbents enter emerging fields at an
   earlier stage and in more diverse ways than has previously been noted.}},

Abstract = {{Rising inequalities and accelerating global environmental change pose
   two of the most pressing challenges of the twenty-first century. To
   explore how these phenomena are linked, we apply a social-ecological
   systems perspective and review the literature to identify six different
   types of interactions (or ``pathways{''}) between inequality and the
   biosphere. We find that most of the research so far has only considered
   one-directional effects of inequality on the biosphere, or vice versa.
   However, given the potential for complex dynamics between socioeconomic
   and environmental factors within social-ecological systems, we highlight
   examples from the literature that illustrate the importance of
   cross-scale interactions and feedback loops between inequality and the
   biosphere. This review draws on diverse disciplines to advance a
   systemic understanding of the linkages between inequality and the
   biosphere, specifically recognizing cross-scale feedbacks and the
   multidimensional nature of inequality.}},

Abstract = {{Research on environmental change has often focused on changes in
   population as a significant driver of unsustainability and environmental
   degradation. Demographic pessimism and limited engagement with
   demographic realities underpin many arguments concerning limits to
   growth, environmental refugees, and environment-related conflicts.
   Re-engagement between demographic and environmental sciences has led to
   greater understanding of the interactions between the size, composition,
   and distribution of populations and exposure to environmental risks and
   contributions to environmental burdens. Wereview the results of this
   renewed and far more nuanced research frontier, focusing in particular
   on the way demographic trends affect exposure, sensitivity, and
   adaptation to environmental change. New research has explained how
   migration systems interact with environmental challenges in individual
   decisions and in globally aggregate flows. Here we integrate analysis on
   demographic and environmental risks that often share a root cause in
   limited social freedoms and opportunities. We argue for a capabilities
   approach to promoting sustainable solutions for a more mobile world.}},

   capacity challenges states face with respect to extraction,

   state capacity is an interactive process, the product of institutions

   argue that the institutions ensuring capacity and the processes that
   bring them into being vary. Our review highlights trends in recent

Title = {{Adaptive pathways and coupled infrastructure: seven centuries of
   adaptation to water risk and the production of vulnerability in Mexico
   City}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Infrastructure development is central to the processes that abate and
   produce vulnerabilities in cities. Urban actors, especially those with
   power and authority, perceive and interpret vulnerability and decide
   when and how to adapt. When city managers use infrastructure to reduce
   urban risk in the complex, interconnected city system, new fragilities
   are introduced because of inherent system feedbacks. We trace the
   interactions between system dynamics and decision-making processes over
   700 years of Mexico City's adaptations to water risks, focusing on the
   decision cycles of public infrastructure providers (in this case,
   government authorities). We bring together two lenses in examining this
   history: robustness-vulnerability trade-offs to explain the evolution of
   systemic risk dynamics mediated by feedback control, and adaptation
   pathways to focus on the evolution of decision cycles that motivate
   significant infrastructure investments. Drawing from historical
   accounts, archeological evidence, and original research on water,
   engineering, and cultural history, we examine adaptation pathways of
   humans settlement, water supply, and flood risk. Mexico City's history
   reveals insights that expand the theory of coupled infrastructure and
   lessons salient to contemporary urban risk management: (1) adapting by
   spatially externalizing risks can backfire: as cities expand, such risks
   become endogenous; (2) over time, adaptation pathways initiated to
   address specific risks may begin to intersect, creating complex
   trade-offs in risk management; and (3) city authorities are agents of
   risk production: even in the face of new exogenous risks (climate
   change), acknowledging and managing risks produced endogenously may
   prove more adaptive. History demonstrates that the very best solutions
   today may present critical challenges for tomorrow, and that
   collectively people have far more agency in and influence over the
   complex systems we live in than is often acknowledged.}},

Title = {{Traps and Sustainable Development in Rural Areas: A Review}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{311-321}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The concept of a poverty trap-commonly understood as a self-reinforcing
   situation beneath an asset threshold-has been very influential in
   describing the persistence of poverty and the relationship between
   poverty and sustainability. Although traps, and the dynamics that lead
   to traps, are defined and used differently in different disciplines, the
   concept of a poverty trap has been most powerfully shaped by work in
   development economics. This perspective is often constraining because,
   as many studies show, poverty arises from complex interactions between
   social and environmental factors that are rarely considered in
   development economics. A more integrated understanding of poverty traps
   can help to understand the interrelations between persistent poverty and
   key social and ecological factors, facilitating more effective
   development interventions. The aim of this paper is to provide a
   critical appraisal of existing trap conceptualizations in different
   disciplines, and to assess the characteristics and mechanisms that are
   used to explain poverty traps in rural contexts, thereby broadening the
   traps concept to better account for social-ecological interactions.
   Complementarities and tensions among different disciplinary,
   perspectives on traps are identified, and our results demonstrate that
   different definitions of traps share a set of common characteristics:
   persistence, undesirability, and self-reinforcement. Yet these minimum
   conditions are not sufficient to understand how trap dynamics arise from
   complex social-ecological interactions. To broaden the utility of the
   concept we propose a more social-ecologically integrated definition of
   traps that includes four additional considerations: cross-scale
   interactions, path dependencies, the role of external drivers, and
   social-ecological diversity. Including these wider dimensions of trap

Abstract = {{Most societies are economically dominated by a small elite, and
   similarly, natural communities are typically dominated by a small
   fraction of the species. Here we reveal a strong similarity between
   patterns of inequality in nature and society, hinting at fundamental
   unifying mechanisms. We show that chance alone will drive 1\% or less of
   the community to dominate 50\% of all resources in situations where
   gains and losses are multiplicative, as in returns on assets or growth
   rates of populations. Key mechanisms that counteract such hyperdominance
   include natural enemies in nature and wealth-equalizing institutions in
   society. However, historical research of European developments over the
   past millennium suggests that such institutions become ineffective in
   times of societal upscaling. A corollary is that in a globalizing world,
   wealth will inevitably be appropriated by a very small fraction of the
   population unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions emerge at the
   global level.}},

Abstract = {{This paper conceptualizes power and empowerment in the context of
   sustainability transitions and transition governance. The field of
   transition studies has been critically interrogated for undermining the
   role of power, which has inspired various endeavours to theorize power
   and agency in transitions. This paper presents the POwer-IN-Transition
   framework (POINT), which is developed as a conceptual framework to
   analyse power and (dis)empowerment in transformative social change,
   integrating transition concepts and multiple power and empowerment
   theories. The first section introduces transitions studies and discusses
   its state-of-the-art regarding power. This is followed by a typology of
   power relations and different types of power (reinforcive, innovative,
   transformative). These notions are then used to reframe transition
   concepts, in particular the multi-level perspective, in terms of power
   dynamics. The critical challenges of (dis)empowerment and unintended
   power implications of discourses on and policies for sustainability
   transitions' are discussed. The paper concludes with a synthesis of the
   arguments and challenges for future research. Copyright (c) 2017 John

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides a retrospective analysis of global environmental
   assessment (GEA) processes and their changing character, focus and
   political context over the past 40 years. We examine how and why
   elements of organizational design, objectives, and the evolving
   political landscape have interacted and changed, with a view of
   informing the design and conduct of future processes. We find that the
   historical genesis of GEAs is closely connected to the emergence of
   environmental multilateralism. However, the prevailing conditions and
   assumptions which originally gave rise to the GEA concept have changed
   significantly over time, giving rise to an increasing demand for a focus
   on response options and policies. We also find that the epistemic and
   process complexity of GEAs has increased substantially, without a
   corresponding expansion in the magnitude and composition of GEA
   management teams. We suggest that developing analytical capacities for
   policy assessment as well as ensuring sufficient resources and tools to
   manage increasingly complex GEAs is essential to ensure their future
   relevance and success. This article is part of a special issue on
   solution-oriented GEAs.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI) is a stock-based comprehensive
   indicator used to evaluate sustainability based on the wealth of
   nations, including a finer scale that considers the wealth of regions,
   in which these indicators are required for governance in the
   administrative regional hierarchies to achieve Sustainable Development
   Goals. However, few studies have applied the measure to finer-scale
   wealth relative to the national level. In this paper, we fill the gap by
   examining the IWI in all prefectures in Japan, where sustainability is
   increasingly being lost as a result of depopulation, an aging
   population, and the excessive burden of environmental regulations. We
   determined that all regions in Japan maintained sustainability from 1991
   to 2000. Then, regional sustainability was lost in 8 prefectures from
   2001 to 2005 and in 28 prefectures from 2006 to 2010. This trend is
   consistent with those found in previous studies, though more severe. The
   decreasing wealth growth is caused by the increasing damage to health
   capital, mainly in rural areas, whereas produced capital has had
   positive effects but has not mitigated the damage. Finally, we
   illustrate how this index can be applied to evaluate projects in
   response to the intense debate in regional public policy for rural
   sustainability through a case study of seawalls as a recovery project in
   the wake of the Great East Japan earthquake.}},

Title = {{Social learning for resilience in social-ecological systems}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{100-107}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fostering of social learning is generally considered an important
   governance instrument to build resilience in social-ecological systems.
   Empirical studies addressing the contribution of social learning to
   resilience are scarce however, and do not provide direct evidence but
   infer this contribution from the impacts of social learning on system
   governance and management. These impacts are found more frequently at
   the local level than at higher, regional or national levels, probably
   depending on the overlap between participants in social learning and
   actors in governance and management. Recent studies have shown that at
   higher levels a connection between social learning and policy can be
   achieved through bridging actors or organizations, and vertical linkages
   between governance levels. Conceptually and methodologically the study
   of social learning and its relation with resilience has advanced
   sufficiently to enable more rigorous and detailed empirical research.
   This should focus on how attempts to foster social learning within
   social-ecological governance systems can be made more effective and
   efficient, for example, through the use of new technologies to support
   the learning process or through the creation of permanent, informal
   multistakeholder learning spaces within formal policy structures.}},

Abstract = {{To date, the field of transition research lacks a suitable vocabulary to
   analyse the (changing) interactions and relations of actors as part of a

   research to allow the analysis of (changing) roles and relations between
   actor roles as indicative of changes in the social fabric and shared
   values, norms and beliefs. It also allows considering the use of roles
   as a transition governance intervention. This includes creating new
   roles, breaking down or altering existing ones and explicitly
   negotiating or purposefully assigning roles, as well as the flexible use

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework for the analysis of technological
   innovation processes in transnational contexts. By drawing on existing
   innovation system concepts and recent elaborations on the globalization
   of innovation, we develop a multi-scalar conceptualization of innovation
   systems. Two key mechanisms are introduced and elaborated: the
   generation of resources in multi-locational subsystems and the
   establishment of structural couplings among them in a global innovation
   system (GIS). Based on this conceptualization, we introduce a typology
   of four generic GIS configurations, building on the innovation mode and
   valuation system in different industry types. The analytical framework
   is illustrated with insights from four emerging clean-tech industries.
   We state that a comprehensive GIS perspective is instrumental for
   developing a more explanatory stance in the innovation system literature
   and developing policy interventions that reflect the increasing spatial
   complexity in the innovation process.}},

Title = {{Bridging the energy divide and securing higher collective well-being in
   a climate-constrained world}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{435-450}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Despite the impressive gains in available energy over the last 200
   years, the associated benefits remain unevenly distributed. Bridging
   this divide only adds to the already daunting challenge of securing
   climate stabilization. In fact, efforts towards the former are more
   likely to conflict with the latter. To be able to address this dilemma,
   the relationship between energy consumption and human well-being, beyond
   its economic dimension, needs to be better understood. This paper aims
   to contribute to the emerging knowledge base, by examining this
   relationship using a proxy for human well-being that also considers its
   environmental and social dimensions. The ultimate goal of this paper is
   to investigate the potential incompatibility between efforts towards the
   achievement of higher collective well-being and those associated with
   climate stabilization. To this end, it provides estimates of the
   additional energy needed and its associated carbon emissions under
   different climate scenarios, and compares them with existing carbon
   budgets. Results indicate that even if new climate policies were
   adopted, emissions associated with higher well-being in all regions
   where improvements are needed could still reach up to one and a half
   times estimated 2 degrees C budgets, and even more so for lower
   temperature increase targets.}},

Abstract = {{The ocean represents a fundamental source of micronutrients and protein
   for a growing world population. Seafood is a highly traded and sought
   after commodity on international markets, and is critically dependent on
   healthy marine ecosystems. A global trend of wild stocks being
   overfished and in decline, as well as multiple sustainability challenges
   associated with a rapid growth of aquaculture, represent key concerns in
   relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Existing
   efforts aimed to improve the sustainability of seafood production have
   generated important progress, primarily at the local and national
   levels, but have yet to effectively address the global challenges
   associated with the ocean. This study highlights the importance of
   transnational corporations in enabling transformative change, and
   thereby contributes to advancing the limited understanding of
   large-scale private actors within the sustainability science literature.
   We describe how we engaged with large seafood producers to coproduce a
   global science-business initiative for ocean stewardship. We suggest
   that this initiative is improving the prospects for transformative
   change by providing novel links between science and business, between
   wild-capture fisheries and aquaculture, and across geographical space.
   We argue that scientists can play an important role in facilitating
   change by connecting knowledge to action among global actors, while
   recognizing risks associated with such engagement. The methods developed
   through this case study contribute to identifying key competences in
   sustainability science and hold promises for other sectors as well.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper assesses whether ExxonMobil Corporation has in the past
   misled the general public about climate change. We present an empirical
   document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187
   climate change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed
   and non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and
   paid, editorial-style advertisements ('advertorials') in The New York
   Times. We examine whether these communications sent consistent messages
   about the state of climate science and its implications-specifically, we
   compare their positions on climate change as real, human-caused,
   serious, and solvable. In all four cases, we find that as documents
   become more publicly accessible, they increasingly communicate doubt.
   This discrepancy is most pronounced between advertorials and all other
   documents. For example, accounting for expressions of reasonable doubt,
   83\% of peer-reviewed papers and 80\% of internal documents acknowledge
   that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12\% of
   advertorials do so, with 81\% instead expressing doubt. We conclude that
   ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science-by way of its
   scientists' academic publications-but promoted doubt about it in
   advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled
   the public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil's discussion
   of the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed
   and sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent
   from advertorials. Finally, based on the available documents, we outline
   ExxonMobil's strategic approach to climate change research and
   communication, which helps to contextualize our findings.}},

Abstract = {{A growing field of sustainability science examines how environments are
   transformed through polycentric governance. However, many studies are
   only snapshot analyses of the initial design or the emergent structure
   of polycentric regimes. There is less systematic analysis of the
   longitudinal robustness of polycentric regimes. The problem of
   robustness is approached by focusing not only on the structure of a
   regime but also on its context and effectiveness. These dimensions are
   examined through a longitudinal analysis of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
   governance regime, drawing on in-depth interviews and demographic,
   economic, and employment data, as well as organizational records and
   participant observation. Between 1975 and 2011, the GBR regime evolved
   into a robust polycentric structure as evident in an established set of
   multiactor, multilevel arrangements addressing marine, terrestrial, and
   global threats. However, from 2005 onward, multiscale drivers
   precipitated at least 10 types of regime change, ranging from contextual
   change that encouraged regime drift to deliberate changes that
   threatened regime conversion. More recently, regime realignment also has
   occurred in response to steering by international organizations and
   shocks such as the 2016 mass coral-bleaching event. The results show
   that structural density and stability in a governance regime can coexist
   with major changes in that regime's context and effectiveness. Clear
   analysis of the vulnerability of polycentric governance to both
   diminishing effectiveness and the masking effects of increasing
   complexity provides sustainability science and governance actors with a
   stronger basis to understand and respond to regime change.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The concept of resilience is used by many in different ways: as a
   scientific concept, as a guiding principle, as inspirational `buzzword',
   or as a means to become more sustainable. Next to the academic debate on
   meaning and notions of resilience, the concept has been widely adopted
   and interpreted in policy contexts, particularly related to climate
   change and extreme weather events. In addition to having a positive
   connotation, resilience may cover aspects that are missed in common
   disaster risk Management approaches. Although the precise definition of
   resilience may remain subject of discussion, the views on what is
   important to consider in the management of extreme weather events do not
   differ significantly. Therefore, this paper identifies the key
   implications of resilience thinking for the management of extreme
   weather events and translates these into five practical principles for
   policy making. (C)2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Pathways: An emerging concept for the theory and governance of
   low-carbon transitions}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{37-50}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The concept of ``pathways{''} has increasingly come to frame the
   challenge of transitioning to low-carbon societies. It also shows
   promise as a bridging concept, encouraging constructive dialogue among
   the diverse perspectives and constituencies evoking its use. However,
   its interpretations and attributes are rarely explicit and have yet to
   be subject to serious scrutiny. This raises important questions for both
   theory and governance as the way in which a problem is framed shapes how
   it is understood and addressed, structuring the possibilities considered
   and privileging certain responses. Therefore, this study explores the
   concept of pathways in the context of low-carbon transitions, exposing
   its conceptions, maturation, and implications. Based on a survey of the
   relevant climate change mitigation literature, this analysis uncovers
   three core conceptions of pathways in the context of low-carbon
   transitions: (1) biophysical, (2) techno-economic, and (3)
   socio-technical. Constituted by diverse perspectives and approaches,
   each of these three core conceptions emphasize different yet
   interconnected dimensions of the decarbonization challenge. This
   analysis also points to several key attributes and functions of the
   concept of pathways. Yet, while the concept may possess a variety of
   features that recommend its use as a critical problem frame for
   low-carbon transitions, it also raises issues that suggest a need for
   further reflexivity. If the concept is cast too strongly in terms of
   individual core conceptions, there may be a tendency to emphasize
   certain dynamics while paying somewhat less attention to others,
   inadvertently diminishing the complexity of the decarbonization
   challenge. Beyond this, there are other facets of the concept that have
   to date received more limited attention, including the implications of
   choices at critical junctures and the evolving character of social
   practices. So, there is room for the concept of pathways to engage more
   fully with the range of complexities embodied by low carbon transitions.

Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{7-13}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sociotechnical systems - for example, telecommunication networks,
   electric grids, large-scale manufacturing systems - are interacting
   ensembles of engineered artifacts embedded in society, linked with
   economies, and connected with ecology. Such systems have been analyzed
   through the lenses of sustainability (largely along the dimensions of
   environmental protection and affordability), carrying influence in the
   literatures of technology innovation, product design, infrastructure
   planning, and service delivery. Sustainability concerns along the
   environmental and financial dimensions have motivated focus on waste and
   emissions reduction, new technology development, and greening of
   industrial ecosystems. The concept of inclusive development, however,
   has not yet permeated the research or conceptualization of
   sociotechnical systems. Two streams of on-going work in inclusive
   innovation and in inclusive wealth analysis offer meaningful avenues for
   future connections. We discuss how the literature on sociotechnical
   systems and their constituent elements of engineered products and
   processes has evolved on the topic of sustainability, how the emerging
   concept of inclusive innovation bridges dimensions of environment and
   social inclusivity, and how inclusive wealth may inform system-level
   planning and analysis of sociotechnical systems moving forward.}},

Abstract = {{Complexity economics has quickly become a powerful research program for
   real-world economics in recent years. This article provides an overview
   of complexity economics, and argues that it is incompatible with the
   ``equilibrium{''} and ``optimality{''} conceptions of the mainstream and
   its ``market economy.{''} Instead, it develops older heterodox -
   including evolutionary-institutional - issues like self-organization,
   emergence, path-dependence, idiosyncrasies, lock-ins, or skewed power
   distributions. Also, the space for emergent institutions through the
   ``intentionality{''} of agents, including their improving collective
   performance, reducing complexity, and others, is investigated. This
   article considers complex adaptive systems through ``games on
   networks{''} in an ``evolution-of-cooperation{''} perspective. Moreover,
   a surge in policy implications of economic complexity has emerged, even
   if still rather general. With some more specific implications derived,
   the article again reveals the close similarities with long-standing
   heterodoxies: namely, pragmatist policy conceptions in this respect.}},

Abstract = {{The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conducts
   policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive assessments of climate
   science. In this review, we engage with some of the key design features,
   achievements, and challenges that situate and characterize the IPCC as
   an intergovernmental organization that is tasked with producing global
   environmental assessments (GEAs). These include the process of working
   through consensus to assess and summarize climate science and the need
   to include knowledge from as many of the 195 IPCC nation-states as
   possible, despite the structural inequalities between developed and
   developing countries. To highlight salient features that are unique to
   the IPCC but that offer lessons for other organizations that conduct
   GEAs, we include case studies on the politics of climate denialism, the
   use of geoengineering in mitigation scenarios, and the links between
   adaptive capacity, adaptation, and global development. We conclude with
   a discussion of institutional reflexivity. We consider how the IPCC can
   model an ethical and participatory response to climate change by
   critically examining, and being transparent about, the relation between
   science and politics.}},

Abstract = {{Human actions are transforming ecosystems across the globe. Six
   frameworks aid in understanding the forces that drive human stress on
   the environment and human responses to this stress. Two of them, the
   stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology
   (STIRPAT) model and decomposition analysis, are approaches to analyzing
   data. Four describe the interrelated system of human actions and
   environmental responses: driving forces, pressures, states, impacts,
   responses (DPSIR); the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework;
   coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and telecoupling; and
   social-ecological systems (SES). In applying these frameworks, attention
   must be given to the scale of analysis and to the effects of context. In
   addition to the frameworks there are four substantial research
   literatures providing theory and empirical analysis of how drivers place
   stress on the environment: a macrocomparative tradition, work on
   household energy consumption, land change science, and research on
   commons. Although these traditions remain somewhat separate, they are
   largely complementary.}},

Abstract = {{Clouded titles to land in remote rural areas of the Global South have
   recently prevented increases in agricultural productivity and payments
   for environmental services (PES), so making land tenure more secure has
   become a priority for policymakers. The historical dynamics surrounding
   land tenure transitions suggest a strategy for reform. Colonial regimes
   stripped indigenous peoples of most rights to land. Newly independent
   states restored these rights for some smallholders through land reforms.
   Later, neo-liberal regimes made secure titles more expensive, and, in so
   doing, made insecure land tenure more pervasive. Spots of secure land
   tenure did emerge when indigenous groups, with outside support, resisted
   efforts by powerful outsiders to expropriate indigenous homelands.
   Because insecure land tenure persists in most forested rural areas, a
   focus on afforestation in deforested areas, where earlier episodes of
   reform secured smallholder land tenure, offers a promising direction for
   future PES and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
   Degradation) efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The article describes the field of sustainability transitions research,
   which emerged in the past two decades in the context of a growing
   scientific and public interest in large-scale societal transformation
   toward sustainability. We describe how different scientific approaches
   and methodological positions explore diverse types of transitions and
   provide the basis for multiple theories and models for governance of
   sustainability transitions. We distinguish three perspectives in
   studying transitions: socio-technical, socio-institutional, and
   socio-ecological. Although the field as a whole is very heterogeneous,
   commonalities can be characterized in notions such as path dependencies,
   regimes, niches, experiments, and governance. These more generic
   concepts have been adopted within the analytical perspective of
   transitions, which has led three different types of approaches to
   dealing with agency in transitions: analytical, evaluative, and
   experimental. The field has by now produced a broad theoretical and
   empirical basis along with a variety of social transformation strategies
   and instruments, impacting disciplinary scientific fields as well as
   (policy) practice. In this article, we try to characterize the field by
   identifying its main perspectives, approaches and shared concepts, and
   its relevance to real-world sustainability problems and solutions.}},

   unions are complicated, multifaceted organizations straddling markets

   their ability to reduce class-based inequity in politics and public
   policy. Declining unionization across much of the developed world is
   eroding workers' bargaining power. Reduced economic leverage puts
   pressure on union solidarity and weakens labor-based political

Abstract = {{What do we know about wealth inequality and democracy? Our review shows
   that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and
   that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by
   the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality
   sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make
   this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other
   than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing
   policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth
   depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures,
   and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair.
   Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic
   process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when,
   where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is
   less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful
   avenue for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods
   and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using
   the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges:
   overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite
   gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and
   partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity
   conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring
   them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex
   adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the
   interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how
   policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the
   behavior of different system components is critical for building robust,
   sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review
   reveals that altering incentives-either economic or social norms, or
   both-can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of
   well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem
   service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and
   economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that
   incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb
   illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance
   reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between
   individual actors and emergent system properties were altered,
   triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest
   that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives
   of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach
   that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In
   short, getting incentives right matters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper contributes to understanding transition politics by
   conceptualizing (shifting) power relations between actors in
   sustainability transitions. The authors introduce a Multi-actor
   Perspective as a heuristic framework for specifying (shifting) power
   relations between different categories of actors at different levels of
   aggregation. First, an overview is provided of how power and empowerment
   have been treated in transition research, and remaining questions are
   identified on who exercises power and who is empowered by and with whom.
   It is argued that theoretical frameworks and empirical analyses in
   transition studies lack precision when it comes to distinguishing
   between different types and levels of actors. In response, a Multi-actor
   Perspective (MaP) is developed, which distinguishes among four sectors
   (state, market, community, third sector), and between actors at
   different levels of aggregation: (1) sectors, (2) organizational actors,
   and (3) individual actors. The paper moves on to specify how the MaP
   contributes to understanding transition politics specifically in
   conceptualizing shifting power relations. Throughout the paper,
   empirical illustrations are used regarding public debates on welfare
   state reform, civil society and Big Society', as well as more specific
   empirical examples of community energy initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between poverty and climate change vulnerability is
   complex and though not commensurate, the distinctions between the two
   are often blurred. There is widespread recognition of the need to better
   understand poverty-vulnerability dynamics in order to improve risk
   management and poverty reduction investments. This is challenging due to
   the latent nature of adaptive capacities, frequent lack of baseline
   data, and the need for high-resolution studies. Here we respond to these
   challenges by analyzing household-level data in Northeast Brazil to
   compare drought events 14 years apart. In the period between droughts,
   the government implemented an aggressive anti-poverty program that
   includes financial and human capital investments. Poverty declined
   significantly, but the expected reduction in vulnerability did not
   occur, in part because the households were not investing in risk
   management strategies. Our findings complement other research that shows
   that households make rational decisions that may not correspond with
   policymaker expectations. We emphasize the need for complementary
   investments to help channel increased household wealth into risk
   reduction, and to ensure that the public sector itself continues to
   prioritize the public functions of risk management, especially in areas
   where the social cost of climatic risk is high.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents insights and action proposals to better harness
   technological innovation for sustainable development. We begin with
   three key insights from scholarship and practice. First, technological
   innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from
   complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions
   operating simultaneously from local to global scales. Barriers arise at
   all stages of innovation, from the invention of a technology through its
   selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Second,
   learning from past efforts to mobilize innovation for sustainable
   development can be greatly improved through structured cross-sectoral
   comparisons that recognize the socio-technical nature of innovation
   systems. Third, current institutions (rules, norms, and incentives)
   shaping technological innovation are often not aligned toward the goals
   of sustainable development because impoverished, marginalized, and
   unborn populations too often lack the economic and political power to
   shape innovation systems to meet their needs. However, these
   institutions can be reformed, and many actors have the power to do so
   through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and
   financing. We conclude with three practiceoriented recommendations to
   further realize the potential of innovation for sustainable development:
   (i) channels for regularized learning across domains of practice should
   be established; (ii) measures that systematically take into account the
   interests of underserved populations throughout the innovation process
   should be developed; and (iii) institutions should be reformed to
   reorient innovation systems toward sustainable development and ensure
   that all innovation stages and scales are considered at the outset.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the role of actors and agency in the literature on
   sustainability transitions. We reviewed 386 journal articles on
   transition management and sustainability transitions listed in Scopus
   from 1995 to 2014. We investigate the thesis that actors have been
   neglected in this literature in favor of more abstract system concepts.
   Results show that this thesis cannot be confirmed on a general level.
   Rather, we find a variety of different approaches, depending on the
   systemic level, for clustering actors and agency as niche, regime, and
   landscape actors; the societal realm; different levels of governance;
   and intermediaries. We also differentiate between supporting and
   opposing actors. We find that actor roles in transitions are erratic,
   since their roles can change over the course of time, and that actors
   can belong to different categories. We conclude by providing
   recommendations for a comprehensive typology of actors in sustainability
   transitions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper distills core lessons about how researchers (scientists,
   engineers, planners, etc.) interested in promoting sustainable
   development can increase the likelihood of producing usable knowledge.
   We draw the lessons from both practical experience in diverse contexts
   around the world and from scholarly advances in understanding the
   relationships between science and society. Many of these lessons will be
   familiar to those with experience in crafting knowledge to support
   action for sustainable development. However, few are included in the
   formal training of researchers. As a result, when scientists and
   engineers first venture out of the laboratory or library with the goal
   of linking their knowledge with action, the outcome has often been
   ineffectiveness and disillusionment. We therefore articulate here a core
   set of lessons that we believe should become part of the basic training
   for researchers interested in crafting usable knowledge for sustainable
   development. These lessons entail at least four things researchers
   should know, and four things they should do. The knowing lessons involve
   understanding the coproduction relationships through which knowledge
   making and decision making shape one another in social-environmental
   systems. We highlight the lessons that emerge from examining those
   coproduction relationships through the ICAP lens, viewing them from the
   perspectives of Innovation systems, Complex systems, Adaptive systems,
   and Political systems. The doing lessons involve improving the capacity
   of the research community to put its understanding of coproduction into
   practice. We highlight steps through which researchers can help build
   capacities for stakeholder collaboration, social learning, knowledge
   governance, and researcher training.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on the determinants of effectiveness in knowledge
   systems seeking to support sustainable development has highlighted the
   importance of ``boundary work{''} through which research communities
   organize their relations with new science, other sources of knowledge,
   and the worlds of action and policy-making. A growing body of
   scholarship postulates specific attributes of boundary work that promote
   used and useful research. These propositions, however, are largely based
   on the experience of a few industrialized countries. We report here on
   an effort to evaluate their relevance for efforts to harness science in
   support of sustainability in the developing world. We carried out a
   multicountry comparative analysis of natural resource management
   programs conducted under the auspices of the Consultative Group on
   International Agricultural Research. We discovered six distinctive kinds
   of boundary work contributing to the successes of those programs-a
   greater variety than has been documented in previous studies. We argue
   that these different kinds of boundary work can be understood as a dual
   response to the different uses for which the results of specific
   research programs are intended, and the different sources of knowledge
   drawn on by those programs. We show that these distinctive kinds of
   boundary work require distinctive strategies to organize them
   effectively. Especially important are arrangements regarding
   participation of stakeholders, accountability in governance, and the use
   of ``boundary objects.{''} We conclude that improving the ability of
   research programs to produce useful knowledge for sustainable
   development will require both greater and differentiated support for
   multiple forms of boundary work.}},

   nations and their sustain ability, in a comprehensive way. The inclusive
   wealth framework is nevertheless fraught with limitations, due to
   questionable theoretical assumptions, gaps in data availability,
   unrealistic assumptions about the future and inability to account for
   distributional issues. We propose a non-exhaustive critical appraisal of
   the index and its underlying framework. We conclude that these
   limitations undermine its capacity to fulfil the requirements of a
   satisfactory sustainability indicator. We argue that most problems lie
   in the substantial discrepancy between the inclusive ambition of the
   indicator and the scarce means to implement it. Whereas the
   interconnectedness of the various assets that constitute wealth as well
   as their complex evolution through time are acknowledged by the
   proponents of inclusive wealth, the way the IWI is computed is rather a
   mere addition of layers of actuarial-like monetary values for a (not
   inclusive yet) range of capital assets. Caution is thus warranted while
   using such an approach, and shorter-range alternatives to pursue similar
   goals are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The call for integrated social-environmental science, complete with
   outreach to applications and solutions, is escalating worldwide. Drawing
   on several decades of experience, researchers engaged in such science,
   completed an assessment of the design and management attributes and
   impact pathways that lead to successful projects and programs and to
   understand key impediments to success. These characteristics are
   delineated and discussed using examples from individual projects and
   programs. From this, three principal lessons leading to successful
   efforts emerge that address co-design, adaptive or flexible management,
   and diversity of knowledge. In addition, five challenges for this
   science are identified: accounting for change, addressing sponsorship
   and timelines, appreciating different knowledge systems, adaptively
   communicating, and improving linkages to policy.}},

Abstract = {{Global markets for agricultural products, timber, and minerals are
   critically important drivers of deforestation. The supply chains driving
   land use change may also provide opportunities to halt deforestation.
   Market campaigns, moratoria, and certification schemes have been
   promoted as powerful tools to achieve conservation goals. Despite their
   promise, there have been few opportunities to rigorously quantify the
   ability of these nonstate, market-driven (NSMD) governance regimes to
   deliver conservation outcomes. This study analyzes the impacts of three
   NSMD governance systems that sought to end the conversion of natural
   forests to plantations in Chile at the start of the 21st century. Using
   a multilevel, panel dataset of land use changes in Chile, we identify
   the impact of participation within each of the governance regimes by
   implementing a series of matched difference-in-differences analyses.
   Taking advantage of the mosaic of different NSMD regimes adopted in
   Chile, we explore the relative effectiveness of different policies. NSMD
   governance regimes reduced deforestation on participating properties by
   2-23\%. The NSMD governance regimes we studied included collaborative
   and confrontational strategies between environmental and industry
   stakeholders. We find that the more collaborative governance systems
   studied achieved better environmental performance than more
   confrontational approaches. Whereas many government conservation
   programs have targeted regions with little likelihood of conversion, we
   demonstrate that NSMD governance has the potential to alter behavior on
   high-deforestation properties.}},

   factors that intensify scrutiny and expectations of transparency and
   that foster civil society mobilization. We test our hypotheses using a
   novel panel data set of 4,750 public companies across many industries
   that are headquartered in 45 countries during 2004-2007. Results show
   that firms that are more environmentally damaging, particularly those in
   countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and global norms, are
   less likely to engage in selective disclosure. We discuss contributions

Abstract = {{This perspective discusses nine conditions for enhancing the performance
   of multistakeholder partnerships for sustainable development. Such
   partnerships have become mainstream implementation mechanisms for
   attaining international sustainable development goals and are also
   frequently used in other adjacent policy domains such as climate change,
   health and biodiversity. While multistakeholder arrangements are widely
   perceived as a positive contribution to addressing global change, few
   studies have systematically evaluated the existing evidence for their
   positive performance. This poses an urgent and important challenge for
   researchers and practitioners to understand and improve the
   effectiveness of partnerships, in particular since their popularity
   increases despite their past track record. The recommendations presented
   are based on own research, a literature survey and discussions with a
   large number or international Civil Society Organizations at two
   occasions during 2014. This article proceeds as follows: first, we
   define multistakeholder partnerships, outline their rational and
   summarize available assessments on partnership success; second, we
   provide a set of concrete recommendations based on lessons-learned from
   over 10 years of scholarship; and third, we conclude with some
   reflections on the future of multistakeholder governance for
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a theoretical framework to study the psychology of poverty
   and aspirations failure', defined as the failure to aspire to one's own

   preferences and same behavioural bias in setting aspirations. We show
   that poverty can exacerbate the effects of this behavioural bias leading
   to aspirations failure and hence, a behavioural poverty trap.
   Aspirations failure is a consequence of poverty, rather than a cause. We
   specify the conditions under which raising aspirations alone is
   sufficient to help escape from a poverty trap, even without relaxing

   theories, scholars, case examples, debates, methods, and (multiple)
   interpretations of environmental justice (EJ), as well as its expansion
   and globalization. We then look to some newly emerging themes, actions,
   and strategies for EJ and just sustainabilities. First, we look at the
   practices and materials of everyday life, illustrated by food and energy
   movements; second, the ongoing work on community and the importance of
   identity and attachment, informed by urban planning, food, and climate
   concerns; third, the growing interest in the relationship between human
   practices and communities and nonhuman nature. We also expand on the
   longstanding interest in just sustainabilities within this movement,
   illustrated by a wide range of concerns with food, energy, and climate
   justice. These new areas of work illustrate both recent developments and
   a set of paths forward for both the theory and practice of EJ.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{425-452}},
Abstract = {{Existing technologies, institutions, and behavioral norms together act
   to constrain the rate and magnitude of carbon emissions reductions in
   the coming decades. The inertia of carbon emissions due to such mutually
   reinforcing physical, economic, and social constraints is referred to as
   carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in is a special case of path dependency,
   which is common in the evolution of complex systems. However, carbon
   lock-in is particularly prone to entrenchment given the large capital
   costs, long infrastructure lifetimes, and interrelationships between the
   socioeconomic and technical systems involved. Further, the urgency of
   efforts to avoid dangerous climate change exacerbates the liability of
   even small lock-in risks. Although carbon lock-in has been recognized
   for years, efforts to characterize the types and causes of carbon
   lock-in, or to quantitatively assess and evaluate its policy
   implications, have been limited and scattered across a number of
   different disciplines. This systematic review of the literature
   synthesizes what is known about the types and causes of carbon lock-in,
   including the scale, magnitude, and longevity of the effects, and policy
   implications. We identify three main types of carbon lock-in and
   describe how they coevolve: (a) infrastructural and technological, (b)
   institutional, and (c) behavioral. Although each type of lock-in has its
   own set of processes, all three are tightly intertwined and contribute
   to the inertia of carbon emissions. We outline the conditions,
   opportunities, and strategies for fostering transitions toward
   less-carbon-intensive emissions trajectories. We conclude by proposing a
   carbon lock-in research agenda that can help bridge the gaps between
   science, knowledge, and policy-making.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Resilience thinking in relation to the environment has emerged as a lens
   of inquiry that serves a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue and
   collaboration. Resilience is about cultivating the capacity to sustain
   development in the face of expected and surprising change and diverse
   pathways of development and potential thresholds between them. The
   evolution of resilience thinking is coupled to social-ecological systems
   and a truly intertwined human-environment planet. Resilience as
   persistence, adaptability, and transformability of complex adaptive
   social-ecological systems is the focus, clarifying the dynamic and
   forward-looking nature of the concept. Resilience thinking emphasizes
   that social-ecological systems, from the individual, to community, to
   society as a whole, are embedded in the biosphere. The biosphere
   connection is an essential observation if sustainability is to be taken
   seriously. In the continuous advancement of resilience thinking there
   are efforts aimed at capturing resilience of social-ecological systems
   and finding ways for people and institutions to govern social-ecological
   dynamics for improved human well-being, at the local, across levels and
   scales, to the global. Consequently, in resilience thinking, development
   issues for human well-being, for people and planet, are framed in a
   context of understanding and governing complex social-ecological
   dynamics for sustainability as part of a dynamic biosphere.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{495-516}},
Abstract = {{Institutions, the rules of the game that shape repeated human
   interactions, clearly play a critical role in helping groups avoid the
   inefficient use of shared resources such as fisheries, freshwater, and
   the assimilative capacity of the environment. Institutions, however, are
   intimately intertwined with the human, social, and biophysical context
   within which they operate. Scholars typically are careful to take this
   context into account when studying institutions and Ostrom's
   Institutional Design Principles are a case in point. Scholars have
   tested whether Ostrom's Design Principles, which specify broad
   relationships between institutional arrangements and context, actually
   support successful governance of shared resources. This article further
   contributes to this line of research by leveraging the notion of
   institutional design to outline a research trajectory focused on coupled
   infrastructure systems in which institutions are seen as one class of
   infrastructure among many that dynamically interact to produce outcomes
   over time.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Social learning studies emerged as part of the ecological economics
   research agenda rather recently. Questions of how human societies and
   organisations learn and transition on the basis of environmental
   knowledge relate to the core ideas of ecological economics with its
   pluralistic understanding of human behaviour in contrast to the limited
   focus on incentive-driven behaviour. Our study analyses the emergence
   and thematic foci of social learning studies within ecological economics
   over the past 15 years. We selected and analysed 54 articles published
   after peer review in established journals adhering to the
   epistemological tradition of ecological economics. This study is guided
   by the interest in how social learning is conceptualised, how this
   research is positioned in terms of process dynamics, causal factors and
   outcomes of learning. Results show, that the number of related papers
   grew substantially in recent years. Also the role of formal or informal
   institutions has been found to be a strong causal factor for social
   learning and change processes vis-A-vis technological, economic or
   political factors. In addition, there is a growing awareness of social
   learning processes in various environmental policy fields such as
   biodiversity governance, water and land management, fisheries, and
   climate adaptation. We conclude that these insights can give new
   impulses to research on socio-ecological transition and to the related
   debate on societal change and transformation processes as core topics
   for ecological economics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This review examines the relationships between politics, sustainability,
   and development. Following an overview of sustainability thinking across
   different traditions, the politics of resources and the influence of
   scarcity narratives on research, policy and practice are explored. This
   highlights the politics of transformations and the way these play out
   under combinations of technology-led, market-led, state-led, and
   citizen-led processes. In particular, this review points to the politics
   of alliance building and collective action for sustainability and
   development. Transformations cannot be managed or controlled, but must
   draw on an unruly politics, involving diverse knowledges and multiple
   actors. This review highlights how politics are articulated through
   regimes of truth, rule, and accumulation, and how understanding such
   political processes has implications for institutional and governance
   responses. The conclusion reflects on future research priorities and the
   methodological stance required for an effective response to the
   political challenges of sustainability and development.}},

   among reproducible capital, renewable resources, and exhaustible natural
   resources. In contrast, strong sustainability emphasizes physical limits
   to this substitution and the importance of maintaining the resilience of
   normally functioning biophysical processes. Recent progress in resource
   and environmental economics has demonstrated the feasibility of
   incorporating strong sustainability features, including tipping points,
   uncertainties, and resilience, to assess efficiency and optimal
   policies. Given that weak sustainability and intertemporal efficiency
   share a welfare theoretic foundation, we ask: To what extent can these
   approaches be applied to evaluate sustainability? We highlight recent
   work on assessing sustainability in imperfect economies and dynamic
   models of intertemporal welfare that embed strong sustainability
   features.}},

Abstract = {{This review covers the recent literature on the geography of
   sustainability transitions and takes stock with achieved theoreticaland
   empirical insights. The review synthesises and reflects uponinsights of
   relevance for sustainability transitions following fromanalyses of the
   importance of place specificity and the geographyof inter-organisational
   relations. It is found that these contributions focus on the geography
   of niche development rather thanregime dynamics, and that there is an
   emphasis on understanding the importance of place-specificity at the
   local level. Whilethere is a wide consensus that place-specificity
   matters there is stilllittle generalisable knowledge about how
   place-specificity matters for transitions. Most contributions add
   spatial sensitivity toframeworks from the transitions literature, but
   few studies suggest alternative frameworks to study sustainability
   transitions. Toaddress this, the review suggests promising avenues for
   futureresearch on the geography of sustainability transitions, drawing
   onrecent theoretical advancements in economic geography. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Variable flows of food, water, or other ecosystem services complicate
   planning. Management strategies that decrease variability and increase
   predictability may therefore be preferred. However, actions to decrease
   variance over short timescales (2-4 y), when applied continuously, may
   lead to long-term ecosystem changes with adverse consequences. We
   investigated the effects of managing short-term variance in three
   well-understood models of ecosystem services: lake eutrophication,
   harvest of a wild population, and yield of domestic herbivores on a
   rangeland. In all cases, actions to decrease variance can increase the
   risk of crossing critical ecosystem thresholds, resulting in less
   desirable ecosystem states. Managing to decrease short-term variance
   creates ecosystem fragility by changing the boundaries of safe operating
   spaces, suppressing information needed for adaptive management,
   cancelling signals of declining resilience, and removing pressures that
   may build tolerance of stress. Thus, the management of variance
   interacts strongly and inseparably with the management of resilience. By
   allowing for variation, learning, and flexibility while observing
   change, managers can detect opportunities and problems as they develop
   while sustaining the capacity to deal with them.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by a concern that adaptation and vulnerability
   research suffer from an under-theorization of the political mechanisms
   of social change and the processes that serve to reproduce vulnerability
   over time and space. We argue that adaptation is a socio-political
   process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple
   and concurrent environmental and social changes. We propose that
   applying concepts of subjectivity, knowledges and authority to the
   analysis of adaptation focuses attention on this socio-political
   process. Drawing from vulnerability, adaptation, political ecology and
   social theory literatures, we explain how power is reproduced or
   contested in adaptation practice through these three concepts. We assert
   that climate change adaptation processes have the potential to
   constitute as well as contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge,
   thereby opening up or closing down space for transformational
   adaptation. We expand on this assertion through four key propositions
   about how adaptation processes can be understood and outline an emergent
   empirical research agenda, which aims to explicitly examine these
   propositions in specific social and environmental contexts. We describe
   how the articles in this special issue are contributing to this nascent
   research agenda, providing an empirical basis from which to theorize the
   politics of adaptation. The final section concludes by describing the
   need for a reframing of adaptation policy, practice and analysis to
   engage with multiple adaptation knowledges, to question subjectivities
   inherent in discourses and problem understandings, and to identify how
   emancipatory subjectivities - and thus the potential for
   transformational adaptation - can be supported. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This conceptual review article provides a critical appraisal of
   Sustainable Consumption and Production research, which is currently
   framed by two generic positions. First, the `reformist' position, which
   focuses on firms pursuing green eco-innovations and consumers buying
   eco-efficient products, represents the political and academic orthodoxy.
   Second, the `revolutionary' position, which is a radical critique of the
   mainstream, advocates the abolishment of capitalism, materialism, and
   consumerism, and promotes values such as frugality, sufficiency, and
   localism. We find this dichotomous debate problematic, because it is
   intellectually stifling and politically conservative (in its outcomes).
   To move beyond this dichotomy, we propose a third position,
   `reconfiguration', which focuses on transitions in socio-technical
   systems and daily life practices and accommodates new conceptual
   frameworks. For each of the three positions, we discuss: (1) the scale
   and type of change, (2) views on consumption and production in exemplary
   approaches, (3) underlying theoretical, epistemological and normative
   orientations, (4) policy implications, and (5) critical appraisal. The
   conclusion compares the three positions, provides arguments for the
   fruitfulness of the reconfiguration-position and offers four critical
   reflections about future Sustainable Consumption and Production research
   agendas. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Distributive fairness: A mutual recognition approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{35-44}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Can norms of distributive fairness serve as pillars of a new and more
   effective global climate regime? Three general principles -
   responsibilities, capabilities (capacity), and needs (or rights) - are
   frequently invoked and rarely disputed. Yet, parties' interpretations
   often diverge, reflecting conflicts of interests. To determine how much
   is at stake, we compare -by means of a global integrated assessment
   model (GRACE) - 15 legitimate interpretations of `responsibilities' and
   `capabilities' in terms of their implications for the mitigation
   obligations and costs of seven potentially pivotal actors. Most of these
   interpretations yield similar results for most actors. In a scenario
   where global emissions in 2030 are reduced by 20\% compared to a
   business-as-usual baseline, mitigation costs vary by less than 1\% of
   GDP for the United States, the European Union, Japan, India, and China.
   For Brazil and Russia, however, variance is much larger. Moreover, for
   all actors, mitigation costs rise steeply as ambition levels increase.
   Under such circumstances, searching for a single `fairness-optimizing'
   formula is likely to fail. As negotiators explore systems of voluntary
   pledges, a more promising approach would conceive of fairness as a
   multidimensional construct and foster accommodation through mutual
   recognition of a limited range of legitimate norm interpretations. (C)

Title = {{Social and Environmental Impacts of Forest Management Certification in
   Indonesia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In response to unsustainable timber production in tropical forest
   concessions, voluntary forest management certification programs such as
   the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have been introduced to improve
   environmental, social, and economic performance over existing management
   practices. However, despite the proliferation of forest certification
   over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness.
   Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on
   environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia),
   we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions
   compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple
   difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC
   reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence
   of air pollution by 31\%. It had no statistically significant impacts on
   fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4
   km(2) on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood
   dependence (by 33\%), respiratory infections (by 32\%) and malnutrition
   (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical
   evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as
   Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and
   data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations
   of a potentially critical conservation policy.}},

Abstract = {{The first public product of the Intergovernmental Platform on
   Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is its Conceptual Framework.
   This conceptual and analytical tool, presented here in detail, will
   underpin all IPBES functions and provide structure and comparability to
   the syntheses that IPBES will produce at different spatial scales, on
   different themes, and in different regions. Salient innovative aspects
   of the IPBES Conceptual Framework are its transparent and participatory
   construction process and its explicit consideration of diverse
   scientific disciplines, stakeholders, and knowledge systems, including
   indigenous and local knowledge. Because the focus on co-construction of
   integrative knowledge is shared by an increasing number of initiatives
   worldwide, this framework should be useful beyond IPBES, for the wider
   research and knowledge-policy communities working on the links between
   nature and people, such as natural, social and engineering scientists,
   policy-makers at different levels, and decision-makers in different
   sectors of society.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on institutional fit is developing rapidly within the
   broader discourse on sustainability which has resulted in a diverse, but
   sometimes inconsistent program of research. Therefore we review the
   recent literature on the fit between institutions and social-ecological
   systems to identify three general types of fit: namely, ecological fit,
   social fit and social-ecological system fit. Each of these draws
   attention to different dimensions of social-ecological systems, with
   their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is
   generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose
   immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build
   theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems. Therefore we present a
   typology which defines and summarizes the three major types of fit and
   can be used to organize and advance systematic theoretical and policy
   relevant inquiry.}},

Abstract = {{In 2014, United Nations member states proposed a set of Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs), which will succeed the Millennium Development
   Goals (MDGs) as reference goals for the international development
   community for the period 2015-2030. The proposed goals and targets can
   be seen as a network, in which links among goals exist through targets
   that refer to multiple goals. Using network analysis techniques, we show
   that some thematic areas covered by the SDGs are well connected with one
   another. Other parts of the network have weaker connections with the
   rest of the system. The SDGs as a whole are a more integrated system
   than the MDGs were, which may facilitate policy integration across
   sectors. However, many of the links among goals that have been
   documented in biophysical, economic and social dimensions are not
   explicitly reflected in the SDGs. Beyond the added visibility that the
   SDGs provide to links among thematic areas, attempts at policy
   integration across various areas will have to be based on studies of the
   biophysical, social and economic systems at appropriate scales.

Abstract = {{In Integrated Assessment modelling of climate change impacts and
   adaptation, there are two main uses for measures of capacity to adapt to
   climate change. The first is to represent the capacity for proactive
   adaptation: this can be termed adaptive capacity. The second is to
   represent the capacity for reactive or instantaneous coping: this can be
   termed coping capacity. Adaptive capacity helps to determine which
   proactive adaptation options are feasible as inputs to the models under
   any given pair of climate and socio-economic scenarios. Coping capacity
   represents the residual ability to react to conditions, and influences
   vulnerability under any given set of model outputs. Using the example of
   the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, we explain how these
   capacities can be represented in integrated assessment. We demonstrate
   how an index of adaptive and coping capacity can be developed using a
   five-capitals (human, social, manufactured, natural, financial) model of
   societal wealth and incorporated in integrated assessment models. We
   find that for very aggregate applications, but not local or sectoral
   applications, the same indicators can be used to simulate adaptive and
   coping capacity. In addition, we argue that it is generally unnecessary
   to account for the depletion of capacity through adaptation itself, and
   that natural capital can generally be omitted from capacity measures if
   it is already directly represented in model outputs.}},

Title = {{Coproductive capacities: rethinking science-governance relations in a
   diverse world}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Tackling major environmental change issues requires effective
   partnerships between science and governance, but relatively little work
   in this area has examined the diversity of settings from which such
   partnerships may, or may not, emerge. In this special feature we draw on
   experiences from around the world to demonstrate and investigate the
   consequences of diverse capacities and capabilities in bringing science
   and governance together. We propose the concept of coproductive
   capacities as a useful new lens through which to examine these
   relations. Coproductive capacity is ``the combination of scientific
   resources and governance capability that shapes the extent to which a
   society, at various levels, can operationalize relationships between
   scientific and public, private, and civil society institutions and
   actors to effect scientifically-informed social change.{''} This recasts
   the relationships between science and society from notions of ``gaps{''}
   to notions of interconnectedness and interplay (coproduction); alongside
   the societal foundations that shape what is or is not possible in that
   dynamic connection (capacities). The articles in this special feature
   apply this concept to reveal social, political, and institutional
   conditions that both support and inhibit high-quality environmental
   governance as global issues are tackled in particular places. Across
   these articles we suggest that five themes emerge as important to
   understanding coproductive capacity: history, experience, and
   perceptions; quality of relationships (especially in suboptimal
   settings); disjunct across scales; power, interests, and legitimacy; and
   alternative pathways for environmental governance. Taking a coproductive
   capacities perspective can help us identify which interventions may best
   enable scientifically informed, but locally sensitive approaches to
   environmental governance.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of literature suggests that more unequal societies have

   relationship between environmental quality and social inequality along
   the axes of income, wealth, political power, and race and ethnicity. Our
   review suggests that the evidence is strongest for air- and
   water-quality measures that have more immediate health implications;
   evidence is less strong for more dispersed pollutants that have
   longer-term health impacts. More attention should be paid in research
   and in practice to links among inequality, the environment, and health,
   including more within-country studies that may elucidate causal pathways
   and points of intervention. We synthesize common metrics of inequality

Abstract = {{Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face
   of perturbations. Although resilience has been a highly influential
   concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we
   describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the
   basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon
   of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small
   perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point.
   Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be
   indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial
   patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience
   of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of
   observations as in long time series or satellite images. these generic
   approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific
   knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the
   resilience of complex systems.}},

Abstract = {{Consumption, although often considered an individual choice, is deeply
   ingrained in behaviors, cultures, and institutions, and is driven and
   supported by corporate and government practices. Consumption is also at
   the heart of many of our most critical ecological, health, and social
   problems. What is referred to broadly as sustainable consumption has
   primarily focused on making consumption more efficient and gradually
   decoupling it from energy and resource use. We argue for the need to
   focus sustainable consumption initiatives on the key impact areas of
   consumption-transport, housing, energy use, and food-and at deeper
   levels of system change. To meet the scale of the sustainability
   challenges we face, interventions and policies must move from relative
   decoupling via technological improvements, to strategies to change the
   behavior of individual consumers, to broader initiatives to change
   systems of production and consumption. We seek to connect these emerging
   literatures on behavior change, structural interventions, and
   sustainability transitions to arrive at integrated frameworks for
   learning, iteration, and scaling of sustainability innovations. We
   sketch the outlines of research and practice that offer potentials for
   system changes for truly sustainable consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive wealth is a measure designed to address whether society is on
   a sustainable development trajectory. Inclusive wealth is defined as the
   aggregate value of all capital assets. Increases in inclusive wealth
   indicate an improved productive base capable of supporting a higher
   standard of living in the future. To be truly inclusive, measures of
   inclusive wealth must include the value of all forms of capital that
   contribute to human well-being: human capital, manufactured capital,
   natural capital, and social capital. Sustainability concerns have
   increased attention on the ways of measuring the value of natural
   capital. We review various attempts to measure natural capital and to
   incorporate these into inclusive wealth including estimates using
   national wealth accounts and integrated ecological and economic models
   used to estimate ecosystem services. Empirically measuring the value of
   various types of capital in terms of a common metric is hugely
   challenging, and no current attempt to date can be said to be fully
   inclusive. Despite the empirical challenges, inclusive wealth provides a
   clear, coherent, and systematic framework for addressing sustainable
   development. Combining measures of semi-inclusive wealth that capture
   forms of capital that can be relatively easily measured in monetary
   terms with a set of biophysical metrics capturing important aspects of
   natural capital that are difficult to measure in monetary terms may
   provide a good set of signals of whether society is proceeding along a
   sustainable development trajectory.}},

   I analyze intersectionality as a knowledge project whose raison d'etre
   lies in its attentiveness to power relations and social inequalities. I
   examine three interdependent sets of concerns: (a) intersectionality as
   a field of study that is situated within the power relations that it
   studies; (b) intersectionality as an analytical strategy that provides
   new angles of vision on social phenomena; and (c) intersectionality as
   critical praxis that informs social justice projects.}},

Abstract = {{The need to adapt to climate change is now widely recognised as evidence
   of its impacts on social and natural systems grows and greenhouse gas
   emissions continue unabated. Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as
   reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case
   studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of
   adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation
   science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and
   focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more
   systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and
   effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent
   decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are
   framed within a ``pathways{''} metaphor to emphasise the need for robust
   decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and
   inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such ``adaptation
   pathways{''} approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly
   identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they
   generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for
   adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of
   vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of
   ``adaptation pathways{''} that draws on `pathways thinking' in the
   sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path
   dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and
   global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions
   constrain societal responses to change. This reconceptualisation of
   adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating
   incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects
   of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The
   paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and
   procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of
   adaptation. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Indigenous and local knowledge systems as well as practitioners'
   knowledge can provide valid and useful knowledge to enhance our
   understanding of governance of biodiversity and ecosystems for human

   assessment programs, such as the IPBES and other international efforts,
   to develop functioning mechanisms for legitimate, transparent, and
   constructive ways of creating synergies across knowledge systems. We
   present the multiple evidence base (MEB) as an approach that proposes
   parallels whereby indigenous, local and scientific knowledge systems are
   viewed to generate different manifestations of knowledge, which can
   generate new insights and innovations through complementarities. MEB
   emphasizes that evaluation of knowledge occurs primarily within rather
   than across knowledge systems. MEB on a particular issue creates an
   enriched picture of understanding, for triangulation and joint
   assessment of knowledge, and a starting point for further knowledge

Abstract = {{Providing food, timber, energy, housing, and other goods and services,
   while maintaining ecosystem functions and biodiversity that underpin
   their sustainable supply, is one of the great challenges of our time.
   Understanding the drivers of land-use change and how policies can alter
   land-use change will be critical to meeting this challenge. Here we
   project land-use change in the contiguous United States to 2051 under
   two plausible baseline trajectories of economic conditions to illustrate
   how differences in underlying market forces can have large impacts on
   land-use with cascading effects on ecosystem services and wildlife
   habitat. We project a large increase in croplands (28.2 million ha)
   under a scenario with high crop demand mirroring conditions starting in
   2007, compared with a loss of cropland (11.2 million ha) mirroring
   conditions in the 1990s. Projected land-use changes result in increases
   in carbon storage, timber production, food production from increased
   yields, and >10\% decreases in habitat for 25\% of modeled species. We
   also analyze policy alternatives designed to encourage forest cover and
   natural landscapes and reduce urban expansion. Although these policy
   scenarios modify baseline land-use patterns, they do not reverse
   powerful underlying trends. Policy interventions need to be aggressive
   to significantly alter underlying land-use change trends and shift the
   trajectory of ecosystem service provision.}},

Abstract = {{Since the World War II, many economies have transitioned from an
   agrarian, biomass-based to an industrial, minerals-based metabolic
   regime. Since 1950, world population grew by factor 2.7 and global
   material consumption by factor 3.7-71 Gigatonnes per year in 2010. The
   expansion of the resource base required by human societies is associated
   with growing pressure on the environment and infringement on the
   habitats of other species. In order to achieve a sustainability
   transition, we require a better understanding of the currently ongoing
   metabolic transition and its potential inertia. In this article, we
   present a long-term global material flow dataset covering material
   extraction, trade, and consumption of 177 individual countries between
   1950 and 2010. We trace patterns and trends in material flows for six
   major geographic and economic country groupings and world regions
   (Western Industrial, the (Former) Soviet Union and its allies, Asia, the
   Middle East and Northern Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and
   Sub-Saharan Africa) as well as their contribution to the emergence of a
   global metabolic profile during a period of rapid industrialization and
   globalization. Global average material use increased from 5.0 to 10.3
   tons per capita and year (t/cap/a) between 1950 and 2010. Regional
   metabolic rates range from 4.5 t/cap/a in Sub-Saharan Africa to 14.8
   t/cap/a in the Western Industrial grouping. While we can observe a
   stabilization of the industrial metabolic profile composed of relatively
   equal shares of biomass, fossil energy carriers, and construction
   minerals, we note differences in the degree to which other regions are
   gravitating toward a similar form of material use. Since 2000, Asia has
   overtaken the Western Industrial grouping in terms of its share in
   global resource use although not in terms of its per capita material
   consumption. We find that at a sub-global level, the roles of the world
   regions have changed. There are, however, no signs yet that this will
   lead to stabilization or even a reduction of global resource use. (C)

Abstract = {{No clear definition of sustainable development exists to guide
   politicians in solving challenges at the global or regional levels.
   Rather, the concept's use has increasingly reflected socially desirable
   attributes of solutions to local- and project-level problems, but these
   ignore the global challenges that the concept was meant to address. We
   return to the original definition of sustainable development used in the
   Brundtland Report and suggest an assessment method to determine whether
   countries currently meet the threshold values of four equally important
   primary dimensions: safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability,
   satisfying basic needs, and promoting intragenerational and
   intergenerational equity. We also define indicators and threshold values
   for each of these dimensions; in addition, we show how 167 countries
   compare in meeting these threshold values. Currently, no country meets
   all four thresholds. Even so, we propose that, with the use of
   technology and behavioural changes, it will be possible to reach the
   threshold values by 2030. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   First, they show that the drivers of consumption that induce
   anthropogenic carbon emissions are similar to but not the same as the
   drivers of place-based (i.e., production driven) carbon emissions.
   Second, they show that a diverse set of countries are able to achieve
   high levels of human well-being while placing relatively little stress
   on the environment. Since the desire of low emission countries to
   increase emissions in pursuit of development is a major blockage point
   in international climate negotiations, the finding that emissions are
   decoupled from increased well-being is not only of scientific interest,
   it could also inform policy discussions.}},

Abstract = {{Elinor Ostrom did not argue that state action is antithetical to local
   knowledge and effective organization. She argued, to the contrary, that
   higher levels of state action are often necessary to solve complex
   common-pool resource problems. In Ostrom's central concept of
   polycentrism, local decision making groups must often be ``nested{''}
   within state structures at a higher level, so that the higher structures
   can provide the coercion and other resources that make local negotiation
   efficient. The state has four potentially crucial roles in a polycentric
   system. The first is to threaten to impose a solution (a
   ``public-interest penalty default{''}) if local parties cannot come to a
   negotiated agreement. The second is to provide a source of relatively
   neutral information to mitigate the problem of self-serving bias
   regarding the relevant facts. The third is to provide an arena for
   negotiating that facilitates low-cost, enforceable agreements. The
   fourth is to help monitor compliance and sanction defection in the
   implementation phase. All four arise in Governing the Commons. Today we
   must also consider the international level, which has no state. Issues
   such as global warming therefore require that we build overarching
   institutions to perform these state functions while at the same time
   preserving the flexible, grounded, local knowledge and participant
   commitment that facilitate legitimate and efficient systems of
   cooperation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scholarship on common-pool resource governance suggests that collective
   outcomes vary with the strength of the local arrangements for compliance
   monitoring. Following Elinor Ostrom's approach to question panaceas, we
   explore the possibility that there are multiple institutional designs
   can help sustain forests. We test this argument with data from a sample
   of 200 forest user groups in Bolivia and find broad empirical support
   for our propositions: Local monitoring can be an important predictor of
   forest governance performance, but focusing on monitoring alone can be
   misleading. Sometimes other aspects of the local governance system, such
   as self-organized rule making and sanctioning, are more important in
   explaining why some groups govern their forests more effectively than
   others. We also find that the more governance functions that communities
   decide to organize themselves, the more likely it is that local forests
   are sustained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   are converging and convincing arguments in favor of using an annual real
   risk-free discount rate going from approximately 4\% to approximately
   1\% for maturities going from zero to infinity. Investing in climate
   mitigation yields highly uncertain future benefits. Such uncertainty
   should also be taken into account in the selection of the discount rate,

Abstract = {{Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity,

   spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that
   high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as
   monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases
   through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes,
   including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting
   resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling
   feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long
   term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent
   with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common
   feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term
   coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an
   effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire,
   drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of
   environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of
   biodiversity should be a high global priority.}},

   theory that offers a unified language for both sustainability and policy

   in wealth, which is the social worth of an economy's entire stock of
   capital assets, not growth in GDP or improvements in the many ad hoc
   indicators of human development that have been proposed in recent years.
   Concurrently, the theory shows that by poverty we should mean a low
   level of wealth, not income, and that the distribution of well-being
   ought to be judged in terms of the distribution of wealth, not income or
   education or the many indicators that are currently in use. I show that
   the concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of assets and the
   idea of investment well beyond conventional usage. This perspective has
   radical implications for the way that national accounts are prepared and
   interpreted. I then sketch a recent publication that has put the theory
   to work by studying the composition of wealth accumulation in
   contemporary India.}},

   rearrangement of the list of relevant attributes of governance systems
   and discuss other ways to make this framework applicable to policy
   settings beyond natural resource settings. The SES framework will
   continue to change as more researchers apply it to additional contexts;
   the main purpose of this article is to delineate the version that served

Abstract = {{The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate
   poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function
   and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we
   experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this
   reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off
   participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over
   the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished
   cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after
   harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time
   available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with
   stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does
   not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears
   that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is
   because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less
   for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective
   and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some
   implications for poverty policy.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of sustainability' received serious attention in the so-called
   Brundtland Commission Report that has many attractive features. In
   particular, it highlighted the importance of intergenerational justice
   while maintaining a concern for the poor of each generation and shifted
   the focus away from resources to human beings. I argue that this way of
   understanding sustainability, while a great improvement, is still
   incomplete. There are important grounds for favouring a freedom-oriented
   view, focusing on crucial freedoms that people have reason to value.
   Human freedoms include the fulfilment of needs, but also the liberty to
   define and pursue our own goals, objectives and commitments, no matter
   how they link with our own particular needs. Human beings are reflective
   creatures and are able to reason about and decide what they would like
   to happen, rather than being compellingly led by their own
   needsbiological or social. A fuller concept of sustainability has to aim
   at sustaining human freedoms, rather than only at our ability to fulfil
   our felt needs. Some empirical examples are given to illustrate the
   distinctive nature and the reasoned importance of seeing sustainability
   in terms of sustaining human freedoms and capabilities.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Globalization, the process by which local social-ecological systems
   (SESs) are becoming linked in a global network, presents policy
   scientists and practitioners with unique and difficult challenges.
   Although local SESs can be extremely complex, when they become more
   tightly linked in the global system, complexity increases very rapidly
   as multi-scale and multi-level processes become more important. Here, we
   argue that addressing these multi-scale and multi-level challenges
   requires a collection of theories and models. We suggest that the
   conceptual domains of sustainability, resilience, and robustness provide
   a sufficiently rich collection of theories and models, but overlapping
   definitions and confusion about how these conceptual domains articulate
   with one another reduces their utility. We attempt to eliminate this
   confusion and illustrate how sustainability, resilience, and robustness
   can be used in tandem to address the multi-scale and multi-level
   challenges associated with global change.}},

Title = {{Separating Adaptive Maintenance (Resilience) and Transformative Capacity
   of Social-Ecological Systems}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Many rural communities are vulnerable social-ecological systems (SES)
   that must do more than become resilient to future environmental and
   social shocks: they must transform to achieve sustainability. We aimed
   first to conceptually explore the proposition that SES characteristics
   (identity, feedbacks, structure, and functions) necessary for
   transformation may be distinct from those necessary for adaptive
   maintenance or resilience, and second, to propose metrics that may be
   used to assess these two types of system changes. We did this by
   interrogating literature and by investigating two rural towns in
   Australia using a combination of quantitative methods and focus groups
   to interrogate community social networks, capitals (human, natural,
   built, and social) and future scenarios. Results indicated that (1) it
   is practicable to carry out a holistic assessment of SES characteristics
   (identity, feedbacks, structure, and functions), and (2) purposeful,
   positive transformation is supported by vision, identification with
   place, unhappiness (with the status quo), high personal contribution to
   social capital, open social networks, and latent capital(s). We conclude
   that rural communities possess capacities for adaptive maintenance
   (resilience) and for system-wide transformation, and that the metrics
   used to assess each are sometimes discrete, sometimes common.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a systematic examination of the use of a Grand
   Innovation Prize (GIP) in action - the Progressive Automotive Insurance
   X PRIZE - a \$10 million prize for a highly efficient vehicle. Following
   a mechanism design approach we define three key dimensions for GIP
   evaluation: objectives, design, and performance, where prize design
   includes ex ante specifications, ex ante incentives, qualification
   rules, and award governance. Within this framework we compare
   observations of GIPs from three domains - empirical reality, theory, and
   policy - to better understand their function as an incentive mechanism
   for encouraging new solutions to large-scale social challenges.
   Combining data from direct observation, personal interviews, and
   surveys, together with analysis of extant theory and policy documents on
   GIPs, our results highlight three points of divergence: first, over the
   complexity of defining prize specifications; secondly, over the nature
   and role of incentives, particularly patents; thirdly, the overlooked
   challenges associated with prize governance. Our approach identifies a
   clear roadmap for future theory and policy around GIPs. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper argues that there is a powerful tendency in forecasting of
   socio-technical change to focus on the causes and consequences of change
   at the cost of greater understanding of the reasons for and significance
   of continuity. Taking the case of the global automotive industry, the
   paper therefore analyses the evidence for systemic continuity in
   technologies, economic structures, cultural positioning and embedded
   social function through the lens of transition theory and the
   multi-level perspective. It is concluded that the observable processes
   are as much about enduring technologies and social practices as they are
   about systemic change. That is, the industry has shown resistance to
   change notwithstanding the apparent imperatives for radical action or
   the multitude of attempts via socio-technical experimentation to nurture
   strategic niches. At a theoretical level, it is concluded that greater
   attention must be paid to understanding how change can be nullified.
   Moreover, theoretical expectations of systemic change need a greater
   emphasis on the way in which technological transition as a process may
   mean that many existing practices and structures are retained more or
   less intact rather than entirely replaced by new practices and
   structures. The future research agenda needs therefore to understand
   more fully how embedded practices and technological change inter-relate
   in specific concrete conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Tipping points in complex systems may imply risks of unwanted collapse,
   but also opportunities for positive change. Our capacity to navigate
   such risks and opportunities can be boosted by combining emerging
   insights from two unconnected fields of research. One line of work is
   revealing fundamental architectural features that may cause ecological
   networks, financial markets, and other complex systems to have tipping
   points. Another field of research is uncovering generic empirical
   indicators of the proximity to such critical thresholds. Although sudden
   shifts in complex systems will inevitably continue to surprise us, work
   at the crossroads of these emerging fields offers new approaches for
   anticipating critical transitions.}},

Abstract = {{This progress report considers the need for developing a critical body
   of research on deliberate transformation as a response to global
   environmental change. Although there is a rapidly growing literature on
   adaptation to environmental change, including both incremental and
   transformational adaptation, this often focuses on accommodating change,
   rather than contesting it and creating alternatives. Given increasing
   calls from scientists and activists for transformative actions to avoid
   dangerous changes in the earth system, and the likelihood that `urgent'
   solutions will be imposed by various interests, many new and important
   questions are emerging about individual and collective capacities to
   deliberately transform systems and structures in a manner that is both
   ethical and sustainable. This presents a transformative challenge to
   global change science itself that calls for new approaches to
   transdisciplinary research.}},

Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is altering the productivity of natural resources with
   far-reaching implications for those who depend on them.
   Resource-dependent industries and communities need the capacity to adapt
   to a range of climate risks if they are to remain viable. In some
   instances, the scale and nature of the likely impacts means that
   transformations of function or structure will be required.
   Transformations represent a switch to a distinct new system where a
   different suite of factors become important in the design and
   implementation of response strategies. There is a critical gap in
   knowledge on understanding transformational capacity and its influences.
   On the basis of current knowledge on adaptive capacity we propose four
   foundations for measuring transformational capacity: (1) how risks and
   uncertainty are managed, (2) the extent of skills in planning, learning
   and reorganizing, (3) the level of financial and psychological
   flexibility to undertake change and (4) the willingness to undertake
   change. We test the influence of place attachment and occupational
   identity on transformational capacity using the Australian peanut
   industry, which is presently assessing significant structural change in
   response to predicted climatic changes. Survey data from 88\% of peanut
   farmers in Queensland show a strong negative correlation between
   transformational capacity and both place attachment and occupational
   attachment, suggesting that whilst these factors may be important
   positive influences on the capacity to adapt to incremental change, they
   act as barriers to transformational change.}},

   with bibliographical analysis of 540 journal articles in the field. It
   is against this background that we position the six papers assembled in
   a special section in Research Policy. These papers pave the way for new
   conceptual developments and serve as stepping-stones in the maturation
   of sustainability transition studies, by linking with the scholarly

   is demonstrated by showing that a properly defined comprehensive measure
   of wealth is maintained through time. Our wealth measure is unusually
   comprehensive, capturing not only reproducible and human capital but
   also natural capital, health improvements and technological change. We
   apply the framework to five countries: the United States, China, Brazil,
   India and Venezuela. We show that the often-neglected contributors to
   wealth - technological change, natural capital and health capital -
   fundamentally affect the conclusions one draws about whether given
   nations are achieving sustainability. Indeed, even countries that
   display sustainability differ considerably in the kinds of capital that
   contribute to it.}},

Abstract = {{The public trust doctrine (PTD) is a legal concept with ancient roots,
   and it is increasingly being examined as a framework for modern
   conservation. At its core, the PTD is based on the idea that certain
   natural resources cannot be fairly or effectively managed by private
   owners. Rather, these resources should be held in trust by government,
   which must manage their consumptive use and protection on behalf of
   present and future citizens. Although historically the PTD applied to a
   limited set of natural resources such as shellfish beds and submerged
   lands, courts and legal scholars have expanded the definition of trust
   resources to include wildlife, oceans, and ecosystem services generally.
   The wide range of interpretations of the PTD is seen as both a weakness
   (because it leads to uncertainty in property ownership) and a strength
   (because it can adapt to accommodate emerging science about what it
   takes to protect ecosystems).}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing the resilience of ecosystem services (ES) that underpin human
   well-being is critical for meeting current and future societal needs,
   and requires specific governance and management policies. Using the
   literature, we identify seven generic policy-relevant principles for
   enhancing the resilience of desired ES in the face of disturbance and
   ongoing change in social-ecological systems (SES). These principles are
   (P1) maintain diversity and redundancy, (P2) manage connectivity, (P3)
   manage slow variables and feedbacks, (P4) foster an understanding of SES
   as complex adaptive systems (CAS), (P5) encourage learning and
   experimentation, (P6) broaden participation, and (P7) promote
   polycentric governance systems. We briefly define each principle, review
   how and when it enhances the resilience of ES, and conclude with major
   research gaps. In practice, the principles often co-occur and are highly
   interdependent. Key future needs are to better understand these
   interdependencies and to operationalize and apply the principles in
   different policy and management contexts.}},

Abstract = {{International environmental regimes-especially those regimes articulated
   in multilateral environmental agreements-have been a subject of intense
   interest within the scientific community over the last three decades.
   However, there are substantial differences of opinion regarding the
   effectiveness of these governance systems or the degree to which they
   are successful in solving the problems leading to their creation. This
   article provides a critical review of the literature on this topic. It
   extracts and summarizes what is known about the effectiveness of
   environmental regimes in the form of a series of general and specific
   propositions. It identifies promising topics for consideration in the
   next phase of research in this field. Additionally, it comments on the
   research strategies available to pursue this line of analysis. The
   general conclusions are that international environmental regimes can and
   do make a difference, although often in conjunction with a number of
   other factors, and that a strategy of using a number of tools combined
   can help to improve understanding of the determinants of success.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary
   success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part
   of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have
   become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities
   worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed
   as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of
   integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for
   development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis
   across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of
   scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution,
   geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration
   structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing
   explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the
   field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their
   interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining
   contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at
   very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional
   disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and
   ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy
   perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives
   has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence
   of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments
   demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of
   sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous
   scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and
   longevity.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2258-2267}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a coevolutionary framework for analysing a
   transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy, based on the coevolution
   of ecosystems, technologies, institutions, business strategies and user
   practices, within a multi-level micro-meso-macro perspective. This
   builds on and develops previous coevolutionary analyses of long-term
   technological and industrial change, and recent renewed interest within
   ecological economics on coevolutionary approaches. Previous work has
   analysed how the coevolution of technologies and institutions has led to
   the lock-in of current high-carbon energy systems; and how the
   coevolution of physical and social technologies and business strategies
   has brought significant material and welfare benefits to the minority of
   the world's population living in industrialised countries. The
   coevolutionary framework proposed here may be used to undertake: (1)
   detailed empirical analyses at a micro-meso level of the challenges
   relating to the innovation and adoption of particularly low-carbon
   technologies; (2) as a framework for analysing the multi-level
   interaction of social and technological elements within potential
   transition pathways to a low carbon energy system; (3) to assess the
   implications for economic growth and prosperity of a transition to a low
   carbon economy; and (4) to assist in the development of more formal,
   multi-level evolutionary economic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Global change issues are complex and the consequences of decisions are
   often highly uncertain. The large spatial and temporal scales and stakes
   involved make it important to take account of present and potential
   consequences in decision-making. Standard approaches to decision-making
   under uncertainty require information about the likelihood of
   alternative states, how states and actions combine to form outcomes and
   the net benefits of different outcomes. For global change issues,
   however, the set of potential states is often unknown, much less the
   probabilities, effect of actions or their net benefits. Decision theory,
   thresholds, scenarios and resilience thinking can expand awareness of
   the potential states and outcomes, as well as of the probabilities and
   consequences of outcomes under alternative decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The energy poor (EP) encompass between 1.25 billion and 3 billion people
   who do not have access to beneficial energy for their cooking,
   illumination, or mechanical needs. Their lives are disfigured by ill
   health, poverty, lack of education, and underdevelopment. The
   universally accepted norm of sustainable development (SD) demands that
   the rest of the world, spearheaded by the rich nations, address the
   plight of the EP. In a welcome response, the United Nations (UN) has
   recently embraced the need for universal access to electricity and
   declared 2012 the ``International Year of Sustainable Energy for All{''}
   with a focus on providing electricity. Although access to electricity
   must remain the ultimate objective, the daunting additional costs of
   electricity, and the time taken to do so realistically 30 years will
   shunt the EP into limbo unless interim measures are also taken.
   Beneficial energy based on appropriate sustainable energy technologies
   (ASETs) can provide such intermediate energy. ASETs bridge the gap
   between capital-intensive electricity and the traditional subsistence
   technologies of the EP. ASETs demand serious consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Although global rates of tropical deforestation remain alarmingly high,
   they have decreased over the period 2000-2010, and a handful of tropical
   developing countries have recently been through a forest transition a
   shift from net deforestation to net reforestation. This review
   synthesizes existing knowledge on the occurrence, causes, and ecological
   impacts of forest transitions and examines the prospects and policy
   options for a global forest transition. The ecological quality of forest
   transitions depends on multiple factors, including the importance of
   natural forest regeneration versus plantations. Given an increased
   competition for productive land between different land uses, a global
   forest transition will require major technological and policy
   innovations to supply wood and agricultural products. In the
   globalization era, national strategies aimed at forest protection and
   sustainable use of forest resources may have unintended effects abroad
   owing to a displacement of land use across countries. Decisions by
   consumers combined with certification schemes and moratoriums have an
   increasing influence on the fate of forests.}},

Abstract = {{The 20th anniversary issue of Global Environmental Change provides an
   important opportunity to address the core questions involved in
   addressing ``global environmental{''} problems especially those related
   to climate change. Climate change is a global collective-action problem
   since all of us face the likelihood of extremely adverse outcomes that
   could be reduced if many participants take expensive actions.
   Conventional collective-action theory predicts that these problems will
   not be solved unless an external authority determines appropriate
   actions to be taken, monitors behavior, and imposes sanctions. Debating
   about global efforts to solve climate-change problems, however, has yet
   not led to an effective global treaty. Fortunately, many activities can
   be undertaken by multiple units at diverse scales that cumulatively make
   a difference. I argue that instead of focusing only on global efforts
   (which are indeed a necessary part of the long-term solution), it is
   better to encourage polycentric efforts to reduce the risks associated
   with the emission of greenhouse gases. Polycentric approaches facilitate
   achieving benefits at multiple scales as well as experimentation and
   learning from experience with diverse policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{POLICY SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{129-156}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There has often been a gap between policy intentions and outcomes in the
   field of natural resource governance. Analysing the factors for these
   discrepancies requires multi-level approaches that relate policy
   decisions formulated at the national and international level with the
   decisions of local resource users. A key asset of the Institutional
   Analysis and Development framework is precisely its ability to link
   multiple governance levels. Yet most commons literature has been limited
   to the study of collective action among local communities without
   considering higher institutional and government levels. To overcome this
   limitation, I posit for a methodological development of the framework,
   which bridges the gap between institutional analysis, power-centred and
   historical approaches, and discourse analysis. The application of the
   extended framework to the study of state afforestation policies in
   Vietnam highlights the need to simultaneously consider institutions, the
   politico-economic context and discourses across governance and
   government levels. As illustrated in this paper, such a framework does
   not only facilitate the analysis of policy shortcomings but also
   supports the design and dissemination of policy recommendations.}},

   Recent developments identify three strategies that make optimal use of

   to, known stresses; focusing on proactive policies that shape change;
   and avoiding or escaping unsustainable social ecological traps. As we

   of known or suspected thresholds that can lead to irreversible (or
   practically irreversible) changes in the productivity and value of
   assets and hence social welfare. These thresholds allow us to identify
   policies or projects that may be leading to an increased risk of decline
   in capital stocks (the wealth of the region). Such risks are not
   reflected through usualmeasures of current system performance, e. g.
   agricultural production. We use the Goulburn-Broken Catchment in
   south-eastern Australia as a case study to explore the significance and
   practicality of including resilience in inclusive wealth estimates.}},

   become increasingly complex and interconnected with respect to the level
   (between local and global) at which they take place, the range of actors
   engaged in them, and the linkages between them and nominally
   nonenvironmental issues. Global environmental politics and governance
   have been rescaled vertically down toward provincial and municipal
   governments and up toward supranational regimes. They have also been
   rescaled horizontally across regional and sectoral organizations and
   networks and across new issues, such as development, security, and trade
   among others. This rescaling reflects shifts in the magnitude,
   complexity, and interconnectedness of the global environmental problems
   humans face as well as epistemological shifts in how humans understand
   and respond to these problems, and rescaling has implications for both
   the practice and study of global environmental politics.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to demonstrate how narratives have the potential to
   bring about organizational inertia by creating self-reinforcing
   mechanisms and blind spots. Drawing on extensive interview data from a
   U. K. bio-manufacturing company, the empirical analysis shows how such
   narratives emerge by constructing a web of related, self-reinforcing
   narratives reflecting a consistent theme. The analysis demonstrates how
   the dominant (success) narrative remains vivid despite the existence of
   deviating narratives and severe crisis. In particular, the empirical
   findings illustrate how narratives construct a self-sustaining frame of
   reference, preventing the organization from questioning the principles
   underlying its past success. The discussion explains how narratives
   create self-reinforcing mechanisms and blind spots. It contributes to
   our understanding of the role of narratives in organizational change
   efforts and illustrates the way such self-reinforcing blind spots become
   a potential source of organizational inertia and path-dependence.}},

Abstract = {{How do organizations survive in the face of change? Underlying this
   question is a rich debate about whether organizations can adapt-and if
   so how. One perspective, organizational ecology, presents evidence
   Suggesting that most organizations are largely inert and ultimately
   fail. A second perspective argues that some firms do learn and adapt to
   shifting environmental contexts. Recently, this latter view has
   coalesced around two themes. The first, based on research in strategy
   suggests that dynamic capabilities, the ability of a firm to reconfigure
   assets and existing capabilities, explains long-term competitive
   advantage. The second. based on organizational design, armies that
   ambidexterity, the ability of a firm to Simultaneously explore and
   exploit. enables a firm to adapt over time. In this paper, we review and
   integrate these comparatively new research streams and identify a set of
   propositions that suggest how ambidexterity acts as a dynamic
   capability. We suggest that efficiency and innovation need not be
   strategic tradeoffs and highlight the substantive role of senior teams
   in building dynamic capabilities. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the context of governance of human-environment interactions, a
   panacea refers to a blueprint for a single type of governance system
   (e.g., government ownership, privatization, community property) that is
   applied to all environmental problems. The aim of this special feature
   is to provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to caution
   against the tendency, when confronted with pervasive uncertainty, to
   believe that scholars can generate simple models of linked
   social-ecological systems and deduce general solutions to the overuse of
   resources. Practitioners and scholars who fall into panacea traps
   falsely assume that all problems of resource governance can be
   represented by a small set of simple models, because they falsely
   perceive that the preferences and perceptions of most resource users are
   the same. Readers of this special feature will become acquainted with
   many cases in which panaceas fail. The articles provide an excellent
   overview of why they fail. Furthermore, the articles in this special
   feature address how scholars and public officials can increase the
   prospects for future sustainable resource use by facilitating a
   diagnostic approach in selecting appropriate starting points for
   governance and monitoring, as well as by learning from the outcomes of
   new policies and adapting in light of effective feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation is a process of deliberate change in anticipation of or in
   reaction to external stimuli and stress. The dominant research tradi
   tion on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an
   actor-centered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond
   to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of
   vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a
   more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of
   resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in
   identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience
   provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to
   identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between
   incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that
   the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across
   scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb
   perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that
   allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews research traditions of vulnerability to environmental
   change and the challenges for present vulnerability research in
   integrating with the domains of resilience and adaptation. Vulnerability
   is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses
   associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of
   capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of
   vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of
   these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to
   environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems
   linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of
   climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The
   challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible
   measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of
   risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the
   mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and
   resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability,
   adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and
   integration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The agent-structure binary in human-environment relations has
   historically ascribed primacy to either decision-making agents or
   political-economic structures as the anthropogenic force driving
   landscape change. This binary has, in part, separated cultural and
   political ecology, despite important research weaving structure and
   agency in each of these and related subfields. The implications of
   approaching explanations of land use using this binary are illustrated
   systematically, drawing from empirical research on smallholder land use
   in the southern Yucatan of Mexico, a development frontier and
   environmental conservation region. The land-use strategies of mixed
   subsistence-market smallholder cultivators are explored through agent,
   structure, and integrated agent-structure models addressing parcel
   allocations to a suite of regionally evolving and/or extant land uses.
   The models are compared to illustrate what understanding is missed by a
   focus on either approach alone and what is gained by joining them.
   Results suggest that focusing on structure or agency alone may lead to
   inadequate and even erroneous characterizations of the variables that
   are of interest to the chosen approach. A sectorally disaggregated
   approach can identify suites of factors that drive particular land uses.}},

Abstract = {{This review,surveys five major efforts to identify and declare values
   essential to global sustainability; describes empirical trends (as
   measured by multinational and global-scale surveys) in values,
   attitudes, and behaviors related to human and economic development, the
   environment, and driving forces (population, affluence, technology, and
   entitlements); and describes empirical trends in attitudes toward
   contextual values that condition sustainable development (e.g., freedom
   and democracy, capitalism, globalization, and equality). Finally, the
   review identifies important barriers between attitudes and behavior;
   draws several conclusions regarding the value, attitudinal, and
   behavioral changes needed to achieve global sustainability; and suggests
   future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper begins from the understanding that women's empowerment is
   about the process by which those who have been denied the ability to
   make strategic life choices acquire such an ability. A wide gap
   separates this processual understanding of empowerment from the more
   instrumentalist forms of advocacy which have required the measurement
   and quantification of empowerment. The ability to exercise choice
   incorporates three inter-related dimensions: resources (defined broadly
   to include not only access, but also future claims, to both material and
   human and social resources); agency (including processes of decision
   making, as well as less measurable manifestations of agency such as
   negotiation, deception and manipulation); and achievements (well-being
   outcomes). A number of studies of women's empowerment are analysed to
   make some important methodological points about the measurement of
   empowerment. The paper argues that these three dimensions of choice are
   indivisible in determining the meaning of an indicator and hence its
   validity as a measure of empowerment. The notion of choice is further
   qualified by referring to the conditions of choice, its content and
   consequences. These qualifications represent an attempt to incorporate
   the structural parameters of individual choice in the analysis of
   women's empowerment.}},
