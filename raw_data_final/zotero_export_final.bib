This article synthesizes knowledge on agency, capacity, and resilience across human development, well-being, and disasters literature to provide insights to support more integrated and human-centered approaches to understanding environmental change. It draws out the key areas of agreement across these diverse fields and identifies the main points of contestation and uncertainty. This highlights the need to consider subjective and relational factors in addition to objective measures of capacity and to view these as reflexive and dynamic, as well as differentiated socially and temporally. These findings can help distinguish between coping, adaptation, and transformation as responses to environmental and other stressors.},

	abstract = {Enhancing the resilience of ecosystem services (ES) that underpin human well-being is critical for meeting current and future societal needs, and requires specific governance and management policies. Using the literature, we identify seven generic policy-relevant principles for enhancing the resilience of desired ES in the face of disturbance and ongoing change in social-ecological systems (SES). These principles are (P1) maintain diversity and redundancy, (P2) manage connectivity, (P3) manage slow variables and feedbacks, (P4) foster an understanding of SES as complex adaptive systems (CAS), (P5) encourage learning and experimentation, (P6) broaden participation, and (P7) promote polycentric governance systems. We briefly define each principle, review how and when it enhances the resilience of ES, and conclude with major research gaps. In practice, the principles often co-occur and are highly interdependent. Key future needs are to better understand these interdependencies and to operationalize and apply the principles in different policy and management contexts.},

At its core, the PTD is based on the idea that certain natural resources cannot be fairly or effectively managed by private owners. Rather, these resources should be held in trust by government, which must manage their consumptive use and protection on behalf of present and future citizens. Although historically the PTD applied to a limited set of natural resources such as shellfish beds and submerged lands, courts and legal scholars have expanded the definition of trust resources to include wildlife, oceans, and ecosystem services generally. The wide range of interpretations of the PTD is seen as both a weakness (because it leads to uncertainty in property ownership) and a strength (because it can adapt to accommodate emerging science about what it takes to protect ecosystems).},

Increases in inclusive wealth indicate an improved productive base capable of supporting a higher standard of living in the future. To be truly inclusive, measures of inclusive wealth must include the value of all forms of capital that contribute to human well-being: human capital, manufactured capital, natural capital, and social capital. Sustainability concerns have increased attention on the ways of measuring the value of natural capital. We review various attempts to measure natural capital and to incorporate these into inclusive wealth including estimates using national wealth accounts and integrated ecological and economic models used to estimate ecosystem services. Empirically measuring the value of various types of capital in terms of a common metric is hugely challenging, and no current attempt to date can be said to be fully inclusive. Despite the empirical challenges, inclusive wealth provides a clear, coherent, and systematic framework for addressing sustainable development. Combining measures of semi-inclusive wealth that capture forms of capital that can be relatively easily measured in monetary terms with a set of biophysical metrics capturing important aspects of natural capital that are difficult to measure in monetary terms may provide a good set of signals of whether society is proceeding along a sustainable development trajectory.},

In particular, it highlighted the importance of intergenerational justice while maintaining a concern for the poor of each generation and shifted the focus away from resources to human beings. I argue that this way of understanding sustainability, while a great improvement, is still incomplete. There are important grounds for favouring a freedom-oriented view, focusing on crucial freedoms that people have reason to value. Human freedoms include the fulfilment of needs, but also the liberty to define and pursue our own goals, objectives and commitments, no matter how they link with our own particular needs. Human beings are reflective creatures and are able to reason about and decide what they would like to happen, rather than being compellingly led by their own needs‚Äîbiological or social. A fuller concept of sustainability has to aim at sustaining human freedoms, rather than only at our ability to fulfil our felt needs. Some empirical examples are given to illustrate the distinctive nature and the reasoned importance of seeing sustainability in terms of sustaining human freedoms and capabilities.},

He reviews some of the major contributions to sustainable development literature including the Brundtland Report which champions sustainable development and a Royal Society‚Äôs study which focuses on the strategic role of sustainable consumption. However, none of these sources examine the importance of a freedom-oriented approach.
The paper contrasts the freedom-based and need-based perspectives of sustainable development. People don‚Äôt simply act to fulfill their needs regardless of the consequences, as the needs-based approach seems to assume. It is important for them to maintain their ability to make choices in development programming. People can act as agents of change, informed about the issues that affect their lives, rather than simply consumers. Maintaining freedom can lead to democratic processes that encourage social change key to sustainable development. 
Clearly at the current historical moment, lack of scientific analysis is probably not the barrier to SD as much as getting citizens to be informed agitators. But what to do when citizens do not trust the knowledge and expertise they would need to be informed?
The article provides several empirical examples outlining how giving greater freedom to specific population can work towards the end of sustainable development. It mostly focuses on population growth.
¬†This links in with the Tellus institutes conclusions on transitions that it‚Äôs less about the science than the building of communities that demand sustainable development pathways and the linking of the local with the global.
It also to some extent links with Lukes/Gaventa but Gaventa outlines the major barriers to informed agitation when communities are held by all three faces of power.
Relevance to project: This paper very clearly is oriented towards empowerment and power through knowledge. Specially, Sen articulates how women‚Äôs empowerment can stunt population growth as they become more informed and employed. Sen also says that how the power of the individual can be heavily constrained by social climate (third dimensional approach). },
	annote = {This is a note about how this paper addresses Sen's larger theoretical concern of capabilities addressed in his book "Development as Freedom"
For Sen, the key issue is that because human beings are reflective, they should be able to "reason" about how they define SD and SD should be about sustaining the freedom (or capabilities) of people to pursue their own definition of sustainability rather than just about fulfilling their felt (biological) needs.
To solve SD challenges Sen argues "We need a vision of mankind not as patients whose interest have to be looked after, but as agents who can do effective things--both individually and jointly" (pg. 7).
Its not that we dont have to look at conflicts on the level of needs, but have to go beyond the role of humans as consumers with needs and consider their role as "agents of change who can--given the opportunity --think, assess, evaluate, resolve, inspire, agitate and through these means reshape the word"
Still, not totally clear what impact capabilities has on how we think about asset managment except that we should manage assets not just for basic needs, but for capabilities. This is what I have from Stiglitz, Sen, Fitoussi thus far... The goal they say is not just self-assessed wants, but capabilities. But what this means is that the assets that are about capabilities are esp important and interventions that expand capabilities (e.g. education) are as well. It was not a very clean answer so far.¬† ¬†

We find that most of the research so far has only considered one-directional effects of inequality on the biosphere, or vice versa. However, given the potential for complex dynamics between socioeconomic and environmental factors within social-ecological systems, we highlight examples from the literature that illustrate the importance of cross-scale interactions and feedback loops between inequality and the biosphere.

	abstract = {A growing field of sustainability science examines how environments are transformed through polycentric governance. However, many studies are only snapshot analyses of the initial design or the emergent structure of polycentric regimes. There is less systematic analysis of the longitudinal robustness of polycentric regimes. The problem of robustness is approached by focusing not only on the structure of a regime but also on its context and effectiveness. These dimensions are examined through a longitudinal analysis of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) governance regime, drawing on in-depth interviews and demographic, economic, and employment data, as well as organizational records and participant observation. Between 1975 and 2011, the GBR regime evolved into a robust polycentric structure as evident in an established set of multiactor, multilevel arrangements addressing marine, terrestrial, and global threats. However, from 2005 onward, multiscale drivers precipitated at least 10 types of regime change, ranging from contextual change that encouraged regime drift to deliberate changes that threatened regime conversion. More recently, regime realignment also has occurred in response to steering by international organizations and shocks such as the 2016 mass coral-bleaching event. The results show that structural density and stability in a governance regime can coexist with major changes in that regime's context and effectiveness. Clear analysis of the vulnerability of polycentric governance to both diminishing effectiveness and the masking effects of increasing complexity provides sustainability science and governance actors with a stronger basis to understand and respond to regime change.},

	abstract = {Cascading effects of regime shifts
The potential for regime shifts and critical transitions in ecological and Earth systems, particularly in a changing climate, has received considerable attention. However, the possibility of interactions between such shifts is poorly understood. Rocha et al. used network analysis to explore whether critical transitions in ecosystems can be coupled with each other, even when far apart (see the Perspective by Scheffer and van Nes). They report different types of potential cascading effects, including domino effects and hidden feedbacks, that can be prevalent in different systems. Such cascading effects can couple the dynamics of regime shifts in distant places, which suggests that the interactions between transitions should be borne in mind in future forecasts.
Science, this issue p. 1379; see also p. 1357
Regime shifts are large, abrupt, and persistent critical transitions in the function and structure of ecosystems. Yet, it is unknown how these transitions will interact, whether the occurrence of one will increase the likelihood of another or simply correlate at distant places. We explored two types of cascading effects: Domino effects create one-way dependencies, whereas hidden feedbacks produce two-way interactions. We compare them with the control case of driver sharing, which can induce correlations. Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that 45\% of regime shift pairwise combinations present at least one plausible structural interdependence. The likelihood of cascading effects depends on cross-scale interactions but differs for each type. Management of regime shifts should account for potential connections.

As R. Boyd and P. J. Richerson point out, ‚ÄúThe enduring influence of Hardin's essay testifies to the power of a clear argument. Should a selfish herdsman add animals to his flock?‚Äù

PHOTO: ALECTRUSLER2015/SHUTTERSTOCK

‚ÄúFreedom in a commons brings ruin to all.‚Äù So argued ecologist Garrett Hardin in ‚Äú[The Tragedy of the Commons][2]‚Äù in the 13 December 1968 issue of Science ([ 1 ][3]). Hardin questioned society's ability to manage shared resources and avoid an environmentally and socially calamitous free-for-all. In the 50 years since, the essay has influenced discussions ranging from climate change (see page [1217][4]) to evolution, from infectious disease to the internet, and has reached far beyond academic literature‚Äîbut not without criticism. Considerable work, notably by Nobelist Elinor Ostrom ([ 2 ][5]), has challenged Hardin, particularly his emphasis on property rights and government regulatory leviathans as solutions. Instead, research has documented contexts, cases, and principles that reflect the ability of groups to collectively govern common resources. To mark this anniversary and celebrate the richness of research and practice around commons and cooperation, Science invited experts to share some contemporary views on such tragedies and how to avert them. ‚Äî Brad Wible 

By Robert Boyd and Peter J. Richerson

The enduring influence of Hardin's essay testifies to the power of a clear argument. Should a selfish herdsman add animals to his flock? The benefit of additional animals flows to the herdsman, while the costs are spread among all who share the commons. Each herdsman decides to add animals, and the commons is over-grazed. Genes or ideas that encourage selflessness will be out-reproduced by those that encourage selfishness, so collective action problems can only be solved with coercive institutions such as police and courts.

This argument is clear and powerful, but wrong. Many village-scale human societies have organized hundreds of people to produce irrigation works and military action and solve commons problems, regulated not by formal coercive institutions but by informal, culturally evolved moral norms. Much evidence suggests that the propensity to be guided by culturally transmitted beliefs is a powerful adaptive tool that has been favored by natural selection ([ 3 ][6]). People in every human society acquire moral beliefs about what sorts of behaviors are right and wrong, and these beliefs can support solutions to collective action problems. For example, in the Turkana, an East African pastoral group, hundreds of warriors cooperate in cattle raids against other ethnic groups. The Turkana have no police, courts, or other formal coercive institutions, but cowards and deserters, tempted by selfish motives to free-ride, are punished by members of the community ([ 4 ][7]). Because norm violators suffer costs, those who adhere to the local norms do better than those who don't. Adherence to norms is self-interested, so genes and ideas that undermine successful norms do not spread.

This means that once they are established, very different norms can persist, even in similar environments. To understand why norms sometimes support collective action and sometimes don't, we need to understand the processes that shape norm content. Competition among culturally different groups is one such mechanism: Groups with norms that lead to economic success attract imitators, and norms that lead to military success spread through conquest ([ 5 ][8]). As societies become larger and more complex, political institutions play a major role in determining norm content and creating supporting formal institutions. However, there are many examples of norm shifts that cannot be explained as a consequence of group competition or deliberate political choices, such as the disappearance of norms supporting dueling in 19th-century Britain and shifts in norms regarding tobacco smoking, premarital sex, and same-sex marriage during the 20th century.

Although historians provide plausible narratives for particular norm shifts ([ 6 ][9]), plausible quantitative theory is scarce. Models based on drift-like random fluctuations make clear predictions but seem too slow to account for change in larger societies ([ 7 ][10]), whereas those based on self-reinforcing cascades ([ 8 ][11]) are fast but depend on an improbable balancing of processes. We think that developing such a theory is crucial for understanding human cooperation. Darwin argued in The Descent of Man that selection for cooperation in ancient tribes, acting over the long run, favored prosocial emotions such as sympathy and patriotism. These emotions, coupled with ‚Äúapprobation of our fellow men,‚Äù contributed to changes in norms, which in turn supported legal initiatives such as the end of slavery in the British Empire in 1833. We have argued for a modern version of his idea ([ 3 ][6], [ 5 ][8]).

When societies are small, and collective action problems are local, group beneficial norms often spread. The most difficult problems are those such as climate change that spill over into many different societies and require people from societies that share few norms or political institutions to create new norms. On the time scale of a century, progress in solving global commons problems has been impressive. It is not clear that for some problems we have another century to spare.

Water is a classic common pool resource: What one person consumes is not available for others, and water's mobility makes it costly to exclude other users. But classic studies of irrigation institutions ([ 9 ][12]) showing that people can and do cooperate to sustainably manage water have been instrumental in refuting the notion of an inevitable tragedy of the commons ([ 2 ][5]). Yet cooperation does not always emerge or survive, particularly in large irrigation systems built and managed by government agencies. Community organizers have been able to strengthen irrigation institutions, but this is generally time- and labor-intensive and difficult to scale up. Millions of dollars have been invested in large-scale programs to introduce, formalize, or strengthen water users' associations, but success in such programs has been limited ([ 10 ][13]). Groundwater is particularly problematic because it is a mostly invisible resource and it is difficult to understand the boundaries of the aquifers and how one person's use affects others.

What then can increase collective action over water? A strong tradition of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research brings together social sciences with irrigation engineering and hydrology, using case studies and comparative studies ([ 2 ][5], [ 10 ][13]). Elinor Ostrom identified design principles underlying effective governance of common resources: clearly defined boundaries, rules adapted to local needs, with users' participation and respected by outsiders, monitoring, graduated sanctions, dispute resolution, and nested layers of governance that fit the resource system ([ 2 ][5]). In addition to these, water scarcity, type of infrastructure, market integration, and social ties among users can all affect cooperation over water. For example, when many farmers in India get wells and no longer depend on surface irrigation for all their water, they stop contributing to the irrigation organizations. Or those at the head end of canals, who get water first, may take too much unless they also depend on the tail enders for other things, such as contributions to maintain the whole system.

Behavioral experiments, originally designed as games simulating commons dilemmas in the laboratories, have been adapted to be played with real commoners in the field. These games have shown the importance of communication, repeated interactions, information, and perceived fairness of the distribution of costs and benefits in influencing collective action. We are testing whether these games could be adapted from a research instrument to a tool that can also help water users understand the trade-offs and potential value of cooperation. In our groundwater game, players choose between crops with different water consumption and profitability and see the simulated effects on aquifer sustainability, showing that short-term profits by some come at long-term costs borne by all. In India, sites where this game was played were significantly more likely to adopt rules governing groundwater use, compared with control communities ([ 11 ][14]).

At a larger scale, multistakeholder participatory processes can sometimes create common understanding and consensus about opportunities for improving the complex governance of multiple water uses and users in river basins, including water quality improvement and reservoir reoperation for restoring more natural flow regimes in rivers ([ 12 ][15]). Ostrom's concepts of polycentric governance ([ 4 ][7]) and the rich literature on multistakeholder platforms and comanagement arrangements between the state and communities ([ 10 ][13]) provide insights‚Äîthough not blueprints‚Äîfor ways to better manage water commons in the future. Payment for environmental services financed by downstream users such as municipal water systems can encourage upstream conservation, such as seen in the Delaware County watershed that feeds New York City, but building trust between government agencies and different types of water users is key.

The practice of managing and using land and other natural resources in common‚Äîwhat the term ‚Äúcommons‚Äù originally referred to‚Äîhas a long history. ‚ÄúCommoners‚Äù exercised rights to use resources over large expanses of permanently uncultivated, or only temporarily cultivated, open country such as heathland, rough pasture, or woodland. Commons were an essential component of early modern agriculture in many parts of Europe until the 19th century; their disappearance (through enclosures) was a key political issue at the time and has been the subject of considerable historiographical debate since. Historians, whose work on commons was for a long time mainly descriptive, have provided evidence that‚Äîcontrary to Hardin's assumption‚Äîhistorical commons were dynamic institutions, with continuous rule-making, changing, intensive communication between the commoners and with effective monitoring mechanisms ([ 13 ][16]). Contrary to arguments in favor of their dissolution, common resources were used in an efficient manner, and improvements associated with enclosing common land and limiting access to commoners were probably not as large as originally thought by reformers ([ 14 ][17]).

A more analytic approach to commons' history, using archival records for many commons dating back to medieval times (in Europe), can provide insights about what makes a self-governing institution resilient for major crises and external shocks. After all, true resilience can take multiple generations and even centuries to surface. Historical sources are often still available, in the form of extensive written rulebooks, in many cases for commons with a lifetime of several hundreds of years during which rules changed frequently ([ 15 ][18], [ 16 ][19]). The reconstruction of these rules demonstrates that regulation often adapted to changing circumstances, and that survival over many centuries was not an exception, but the norm. Those rule books provide essentially the same type of data as collected through fieldwork by Ostrom and colleagues ([ 2 ][5]), but whereas Ostrom's list of design principles is the common denominator of a large set of commons studied at a specific moment in time, the historical data allow for a longitudinal study of the temporal dynamics of a common, of governance that needed to adapt or else collapse. An ongoing study of large datasets of 30 historical commons across the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom ([ 15 ][18]) is suggesting some ways in which Ostrom's list, and work building on it, may need to be updated. For example, sanctioning‚Äîin particular, graduated sanction, incrementally based on the repetition of violations‚Äîhas been seen as an essential component to make self-governing commons work, yet graduated sanctioning is hardly ever found in commons surviving more than 200 years (the minimum years of survival as set in the study) ([ 17 ][20]). This suggests that in order to achieve long-term survival, this particular type of sanctioning may have been less essential than suggested in Ostrom's principles, and that those commons with graduated sanctioning in Ostrom's database may have been through a severe period, with many trials and errors of sanctioning, with the graduated version as the very last resort. Futhermore, analyzing rules and sanctions over the lifetime of several commons, there appears to be an inverse correlation between the effort put into developing sanctions (expressed as the number of rules accompanied by a sanction) and the longevity of a common (expressed as the number of years between emergence and dissolution), suggesting that commons that managed to survive longest invested least in designing and applying sanctions ([ 18 ][21]). This counterintuitive result may be explained by the longer-lasting commons investing more time and effort in (compulsory) commoners' meetings, leading to a more thorough understanding by commoners of why rules‚Äîand changes thereof‚Äîwere necessary, and possibly, as a consequence, leading to less free-riding. Historical analysis can add unexpected insights to our understanding of which methods can be used to keep commons functioning in the long run, steering them away from a tragedy.

Over the past five decades, we have come to a deep understanding of commons problems and how to solve them: They are not zero-sum games, but instead offer substantial gains from cooperation. Game theory and market design have helped us understand how to provide appropriate incentives ([ 19 ][22]‚Äì[ 21 ][23]). For instance, taxes as well as cap-and-trade systems can be designed to make the price of emitting carbon include its ultimate social/climate cost, and subsidies can make the prices of alternative technologies reflect their ultimate social benefit. However, a challenge with global commons problems is that solving the incentive problems often leads the collective gains to be distributed very unevenly ([ 22 ][24]); the costs can even outweigh the benefits for some parties. There are many players with enormous differences in wealth and interests around the planet‚Äîboth within and across countries‚Äîfacing different consequences from commons problems and abilities to pay for them. Yet, universal cooperation is needed, including coordinated limits and the willingness and the ability to enforce those limits. Thus, the main challenges that we face are political. Crafting a policy that addresses everyone's needs becomes an even bigger challenge when combined with constantly changing political leadership with short-term perspectives and impatient citizens who make it difficult to incur large costs today for benefits that may not accrue for decades and involve considerable uncertainty and may affect others more than themselves. A natural reaction to this is to try to simplify things by concentrating on one issue at a time. Although this may seem sensible at first blush, the key to crafting policies that address a multitude of conflicting interests is actually to couple issues together ([ 23 ][25]). If there is an issue on which a group has little to gain and much to lose, then one gets their consent by including some other issue on which they have much to gain and little to lose. This is a principle underlying omnibus legislation: the packaging of unrelated issues into one large bill ([ 24 ][26]). Global organizations such as the United Nations have wide scope and can envision such compromise, but they are funded at a handful of billions of dollars when tens of trillions are at stake, and they lack full international buy-in and trust. The exception is the World Trade Organization (WTO); more than half of world gross domestic product crosses country borders. However, the WTO's scope is limited to trade agreements. In the absence of a world organization with sufficient jurisdiction and large enough carrots and sticks, there is a need for the leadership of key countries to step up and craft an omnibus agreement that couples commons problems with other issues, with something for everyone. Packaging issues produces an attractive agreement that entices participation, rather than coercing it by threatening nonparticipants with trade sanctions that may run afoul of existing treaties, fuel a trade war, or be costly to follow through with. Coupling global commons problems with other large issues will complicate our lives, but it is the only way to forge and enforce agreements at an appropriate scale, which everyone will sign onto. Without powerful international leadership, large global commons problems will continue to be ceded to humanitarian organizations and the voluntary behaviors of groups here and there.

Uncoordinated management of fishing, shipping, and seabed mining challenges the health, productivity, and resilience of the global ocean commons.

In many ways, the global ocean beyond national boundaries‚Äîtwothirds of the ocean's surface‚Äîepitomises the tragedy of the commons. Access remains difficult to control, resources are declining, and pollution pervades the deepest abyss ([ 25 ][27]). Combined with ocean warming, deoxygenation, and acidification, these impacts undermine ocean health, productivity, and resilience, exacerbating the challenge of achieving equitable and sustainable management of our shared ocean ([ 26 ][28]).

Since Hardin in 1968, the concept of the global ocean commons has evolved. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) tempered the right of States to access resources of the high seas and international seabed (‚Äúthe Area‚Äù) with obligations to build capacity, advance scientific knowledge, and protect the environment. UNCLOS further designated the Area and its mineral resources as the ‚Äúcommon heritage of mankind‚Äù to be managed by the International Seabed Authority for ‚Äúthe benefit of mankind as a whole.‚Äù In the 1990s, States acknowledged that biodiversity loss and climate change were ‚Äúcommon concerns‚Äù ([ 27 ][29]). More recently, concepts such as precaution, ecosystem-based approaches, and marine protected areas (MPAs) have been incorporated into international commitments ([ 27 ][29]), including United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 14.

However, global ocean health remains under threat because mechanisms to enable and enforce existing UNCLOS obligations remain weak ([ 25 ][27]). Despite new technologies to monitor activities and impacts ([ 28 ][30]), the current system of managing fishing, shipping, and seabed mining separately begets inconsistent, conflicting, and frequently unsustainable results ([ 25 ][27]). For example, illegal fishing is worse in some places than others; mineral exploration rights are being granted atop important fishing, scientific research, and cable sites; and biodiversity values are frequently ignored ([ 25 ][27]). Meanwhile, the lack of centralized reporting hinders efforts to hold accountable the few that block conservation measures despite treaty requirements ([ 27 ][29], [ 29 ][31]) and compelling evidence of need ([ 26 ][28]). In the Southern Ocean, for instance, compromises made to secure consensus for the Ross Sea MPA ([ 29 ][31]) highlighted the power of a very few states to weaken protections.

Conversely, on the rare occasions that the UN has called on sectoral bodies to implement specific requirements to tackle threats to biodiversity, substantial progress has been made. A 2006 UN resolution requiring states sponsoring bottom fishing to conduct prior assessments, adopt measures to avoid substantial impacts, and crucially, report to the UN has protected vast areas of the deep seabed. However, as ocean stressors multiply, the UN has recognized the need for a more comprehensive approach to biodiversity conservation and use ([ 25 ][27]).

In September, the UN convened the first intergovernmental conference to negotiate a legally binding agreement under UNCLOS for conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. The negotiations present an opportunity to elaborate and modernize existing requirements to conduct environmental impact assessments; proactively adopt conservation measures, including MPAs; avoid substantial harm to biodiversity; and improve accountability through regular reporting. The agreement can thus create rules, monitoring systems, and sanctioning powers to enhance compliance while ensuring more sustainable outcomes at the global, regional, and sectoral levels.

Science also has a major role to play as a catalyst for unifying stakeholders behind common concerns ([ 30 ][32]). The agreement can boost capacity and understanding by fostering collaboration in marine science, knowledge exchange, and technology transfer, including on marine genetic resources ([ 30 ][32]). The UN Decade of Ocean Science 2021‚Äì2030 could further facilitate knowledge advancement and collective capacity to enable informed, equitable, and sustainable management of our global ocean commons. The question is, will states adopt the mutual restraints and allocate the required resources to evade tragedy and renew ocean health? There is hope, but little time. An ambitious agreement is needed by 2020 to protect our common interest in a healthy, productive, and resilient ocean in the challenging decades to come.

Intellectual resources have their own tragedy-of-the-commons allegory. Replace Hardin's pasture with an idea, and consider what happens when the resource, the idea, is openly accessible to all. Everyone who can profitably make use of the idea will do so, as much and as often and in whatever manner suits them. But ideas are public goods, not common pool resources; ideas are not congested or depleted by overuse. Unlike the pasture, unconstrained consumption of ideas seems good, and often it is.

But there's a catch. Ideas are products of human intellect, often requiring investment of time, effort, and capital. Unconstrained consumption by free riders, who invest little or nothing in creating the ideas, presents a risk for those who might make such investments in creating knowledge because they may struggle to recover a sufficient return on their investment. Anticipating this, they may underinvest, contributing to tragic underproduction of intellectual resources.

Avoiding cultural, technological, and scientific stagnation thus seems to require collective action to ensure adequate investment in knowledge creation. To facilitate this, many analysts assume two options: government subsidies or intellectual property-enabled markets. Though both are indeed important drivers of knowledge production, so are ‚Äúknowledge commons,‚Äù which we should not take for granted.

Knowledge commons refers to institutionalized community governance of the sharing and, in many cases, creation and curation of intellectual and cultural resources ([ 31 ][33]). Examples range from scientific research commons, including data, literature, and research materials ([ 32 ][34]), to intellectual property pools, entrepreneurial/user innovation commons, rare-disease clinical research consortia, open-source software projects, and Wikipedia ([ 31 ][33]). Understanding how such communities share and develop knowledge is crucial in today's ‚Äúinformation society.‚Äù

Following Ostrom ([ 2 ][5], [ 33 ][35]) and Hess and Ostrom ([ 34 ][36]), we have worked to systematize the study of knowledge commons and build a new field of interdisciplinary research in which law, economics, sociology, political science, network science, and other fields converge. Dozens of case studies have begun to reveal an empirical picture of knowledge commons. A representative theme is that knowledge commons confront diverse social dilemmas not reducible to the simple free rider or tragic commons. Rare-disease research consortia, for example, address numerous governance challenges, including allocating research funding, authorship credit, and other rivalrous resources; overcoming potential anticommons dilemmas arising from researchers' incentives to hoard access to patients and their data; maintaining privacy, security, and the trust of patients and their families; reducing transaction costs of cooperation between widely dispersed researchers; and managing interactions with outsiders, such as pharmaceutical companies. The diversity of dilemmas is matched by the surprising diversity of participants critical to successful collaboration. Hardin's sheep-herder must be replaced with researchers, clinicians, patients, site coordinators, funders, third-party data custodians, and even government officials.

Despite growing evidence, we're still far from design principles, much less strong prescriptions. Yet social demand for trusted governance of shared knowledge resources, ranging from medical data ([ 35 ][37]) to algorithmically generated intelligence, is growing, even as public trust in governments and markets as sources of governance seems tenuous. Many researchers and policymakers understood the scope of Ostrom's commons-based framework as limited, for example, to small communities managing local resources. Now, more than ever, we need to explore if, when, and how commons governance can scale.

Antimicrobial use could be decreased if overuse led to loss of good reputation, and rules for prescribing established boundaries of ‚Äúreputable‚Äù behaviors.

It has become commonplace ([ 36 ][38]‚Äì[ 38 ][39]) to refer to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a tragedy of the commons. Each individual wishes to use the common-pool resource of functioning antimicrobials whenever they might have a beneficial effect (whether in treating human illness or in raising livestock), but overuse accelerates the spread of drug-resistant pathogens, so the drugs become useless to all‚Äîand therein lies the tragedy. One way or another, some individual freedoms must be sacrificed in order to maintain a valuable resource for the common good. Whereas Hardin emphasized private or state ownership to achieve this, Ostrom argued that those who share in exploiting a common-pool resource can develop their own rules to prevent its overuse. She identified factors that are conducive to the establishment of effective institutions to regulate the exploitation of a resource: Users have common interests; they place a high value on the resource far into the future; users support effective monitoring; accurate information is valued and easily communicated; and it is feasible to establish binding and enforceable regulations. Ostrom warned that large groups often struggle to govern common pool resources and that boundary rules are needed to determine rights and responsibilities.

Many of Ostrom's observations are starting to be fulfilled in the search for solutions to the problems of AMR, even if few people in this area explicitly set out to apply her work. The growing threat of AMR is increasingly understood by medical professionals, policy professionals, and the public alike. The associated discourse reflects the common, long-term interests of these diverse users ([ 39 ][40]). The widely accepted need for better surveillance of AMR signals rising support for effective monitoring and accurate, shared information. In a growing search for effective rules, physicians are adhering more strictly to evidence-based guidance for diagnosing infections; for infection control in hospitals; for procuring, prescribing and dispensing antimicrobials; and for ensuring that patients complete treatments. Beyond codes of practice, governments have in some settings introduced methods of enforcement, such as restricting the use of essential drugs to certified treatment centres. And public health specialists have called for AMR to be included among the International Health Regulations, a legally binding agreement to prevent the international spread of disease. Last, the global nature of the challenge is acknowledged in the World Health Organization's leadership in developing new norms for using existing antimicrobials and investing in new ones ([ 40 ][41]).

Some other useful ideas arise when AMR is viewed as a tragedy of the commons. For example, a desire not to be seen as selfish offers a potential solution: antimicrobial use could be decreased if overuse led to loss of good reputation, and rules for appropriate prescribing helped establish boundaries of ‚Äúreputable‚Äù behaviors ([ 41 ][42]). Further, the ‚Äúlarge groups‚Äù problem may be less acute if local effects are strong enough that a region or nation can benefit from reducing their own usage, even if their neighbors do not ([ 42 ][43]).

In 1968, Hardin remarked that the tragedy of the commons was understood mostly as a set of special cases rather than as a general problem of resource management. The AMR tragedy will benefit from the application of the broad principles of governing a wide range of common pool resources. That will bring focus, for example, to the question of ‚Äúboundary rules‚Äù. Can one country ever manage AMR alone, and can AMR for human infections be controlled without also controlling agricultural use? Also uncertain is the best mechanism of control: When are binding and enforceable regulations preferred over guidelines and codes of practice? How can the principles laid out by Hardin and Ostrom guide the creation of new resources (discovery of antimicrobials), besides conserving the ones we already have? In the face of these pressing questions, taking a broader view of the AMR tragedy, and of its resolution, will show how best to govern the antimicrobial commons.

We summarize changes that have been made to this framework and discuss a few remaining ambiguities in its formulation. Specifically, we offer a tentative rearrangement of the list of relevant attributes of governance systems and discuss other ways to make this framework applicable to policy settings beyond natural resource settings. The SES framework will continue to change as more researchers apply it to additional contexts; the main purpose of this article is to delineate the version that served as the basis for the theoretical innovations and empirical analyses detailed in other contributions to this special issue.},

"The IAD framework explicitly distinguishes three levels of analysis at which different types of choice processes take place: operational, collective, and constitutional. At the operational level, actors (either as individuals or as representatives of collective entities) make practical choices among their available options. Options are determined by both collective-level choices involving the determination of which strategies, norms, and rules are, should be, or are not available to actors fulfilling the specific roles defined by that group (as well as specifying who is assigned to fill these roles) and constitutional-level choices relating to who is or should be empowered to participate in the making of collective and operational-level decisions. The rules that define and constrain the operational activities of individual citizens and officials are established by previous or concurrent collective-choice processes, and the rules by which these rules themselves are subject to modification are determined through a process of constitutional choice. The critical insight behind this framework is that the outcomes of interactions in different levels of analysis are explicitly connected to each other."},

	abstract = {In 2014, United Nations member states proposed a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as reference goals for the international development community for the period 2015‚Äì2030. The proposed goals and targets can be seen as a network, in which links among goals exist through targets that refer to multiple goals. Using network analysis techniques, we show that some thematic areas covered by the SDGs are well connected with one another. Other parts of the network have weaker connections with the rest of the system. The SDGs as a whole are a more integrated system than the MDGs were, which may facilitate policy integration across sectors. However, many of the links among goals that have been documented in biophysical, economic and social dimensions are not explicitly reflected in the SDGs. Beyond the added visibility that the SDGs provide to links among thematic areas, attempts at policy integration across various areas will have to be based on studies of the biophysical, social and economic systems at appropriate scales.

A longer WP version available through "Related Items";
An interesting finding* of the paper is that "Goal 12 (Ensuring Sustainable Production and Consumption) has the most network connections (14) to the other goals. This would be fairly intuitive in terms of the broad economic nexus of the goal but the linkages to the other environmentally-linked goals deserves attention. This goal is most directly linked to pollution externality concerns and the network analysis highlights how reaching the broadest range of development outcomes can have an impact on the environmental sustainability of production and consumption systems."

	abstract = {Countries regularly track gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator of their economic progress, but not wealth‚ÄîAthe assets such as infrastructure, forests, minerals, and human capital that produce GDP. In contrast, corporations routinely report on both their income and assets to assess their economic health and prospects for the future. Wealth accounts allow countries to take stock of their assets to monitor the sustainability of development, an urgent concern today for all countries.

The Changing Wealth of Nations 2018: Building a Sustainable Future covers national wealth for 141 countries over 20 years (1995‚Äì2014) as the sum of produced capital, 19 types of natural capital, net foreign assets, and human capital overall as well as by gender and type of employment. Great progress has been made in estimating wealth since the fi rst volume, Where Is the Wealth of Nations? Measuring Capital for the 21st Century, was published in 2006. New data substantially improve estimates of natural capital, and, for the fi rst time, human capital is measured by using household surveys to estimate lifetime earnings.

The Changing Wealth of Nations 2018 begins with a review of global and regional trends in wealth over the past two decades and provides examples of how wealth accounts can be used for the analysis of development patterns. Several chapters discuss the new work on human capital and its application in development policy. The book then tackles elements of natural capital that are not yet fully incorporated in the wealth accounts: air pollution, marine fi sheries, and ecosystems.

This book targets policy makers but will engage anyone committed to building a sustainable future for the planet.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Gulf Coast provides a valuable setting to study deeply connected natural and human interactions and feedbacks that have led to a complex, interconnected coastal system. The physical landscape in the region has changed significantly due to broad-scale, long-term processes such as coastal subsidence and river sediment deposition as well as short-term episodic events such as hurricanes. Modifications from human activities, including building levees and canals and constructing buildings and roads, have left their own imprint on the natural landscape. This coupled natural-human coastal system and the individual aspects within it (physical, ecological, and human) are under increased pressure from accelerating environmental stressors such as sea level rise, intensifying hurricanes, and continued population increase with its accompanying coastal development. Promoting the resilience and maintaining the habitability of the Gulf Coast into the future will need improved understanding of the coupled natural-human coastal system, as well as effective sharing of this understanding in support of decision-making and policies.

Understanding the Long-term Evolution of the Coupled Natural-Human Coastal System presents a research agenda meant to enable a better understanding of the multiple and interconnected factors that influence long-term processes along the Gulf Coast. This report identifies scientific and technical gaps in understanding the interactions and feedbacks between human and natural processes, defines essential components of a research and development program in response to the identified gaps, and develops priorities for critical areas of research.},

	abstract = {"How moving beyond GDP will improve well-being and sustainability Never before in human history have we produced so much data, and this empirical revolution has shaped economic research and policy profoundly. But are we measuring, and thus managing, the right things‚Äìthose that will help us solve the real social, economic, political, and environmental challenges of the twenty-first century? In Measuring Tomorrow, Eloi Laurent argues that we need to move away from narrowly useful metrics such as gross domestic product and instead use broader ones that aim at well-being, resilience, and sustainability. By doing so, countries will be able to shift their focus away from infinite and unrealistic growth and toward social justice and quality of life for their citizens. The time has come for these broader metrics to become more than just descriptive, Laurent argues; applied carefully by private and public decision makers, they can foster genuine progress. He begins by taking stock of the booming field of well-being and sustainability indicators, and explains the insights that the best of these can offer. He then shows how these indicators can be used to develop new policies, from the local to the global. An essential resource for scholars, students, and policymakers, Measuring Tomorrow covers all aspects of well-being‚Äìincluding health, education, and the environment‚Äìand incorporates a broad range of data and fascinating case studies from around the world: not just the United States and Europe but also China, Africa, the Middle East, and India."‚Äì},

	abstract = {Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science and R\&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames. Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative innovation policy should be a priority.},

We also expand on the longstanding interest in just sustainabilities within this movement, illustrated by a wide range of concerns with food, energy, and climate justice.

	abstract = {Existing technologies, institutions, and behavioral norms together act to constrain the rate and magnitude of carbon emissions reductions in the coming decades. The inertia of carbon emissions due to such mutually reinforcing physical, economic, and social constraints is referred to as carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in is a special case of path dependency, which is common in the evolution of complex systems. However, carbon lock-in is particularly prone to entrenchment given the large capital costs, long infrastructure lifetimes, and interrelationships between the socioeconomic and technical systems involved. Further, the urgency of efforts to avoid dangerous climate change exacerbates the liability of even small lock-in risks. Although carbon lock-in has been recognized for years, efforts to characterize the types and causes of carbon lock-in, or to quantitatively assess and evaluate its policy implications, have been limited and scattered across a number of different disciplines. This systematic review of the literature synthesizes what is known about the types and causes of carbon lock-in, including the scale, magnitude, and longevity of the effects, and policy implications. We identify three main types of carbon lock-in and describe how they coevolve: (a) infrastructural and technological, (b) institutional, and (c) behavioral. Although each type of lock-in has its own set of processes, all three are tightly intertwined and contribute to the inertia of carbon emissions. We outline the conditions, opportunities, and strategies for fostering transitions toward less-carbon-intensive emissions trajectories. We conclude by proposing a carbon lock-in research agenda that can help bridge the gaps between science, knowledge, and policy-making.},

In particular, this review points to the politics of alliance building and collective action for sustainability and development. Transformations cannot be managed or controlled, but must draw on an unruly politics, involving diverse knowledges and multiple actors. This review highlights how politics are articulated through regimes of truth, rule, and accumulation, and how understanding such political processes has implications for institutional and governance responses. The conclusion reflects on future research priorities and the methodological stance required for an effective response to the political challenges of sustainability and development.},

Four describe the interrelated system of human actions and environmental responses: driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, responses (DPSIR); the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework; coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) and telecoupling; and social-ecological systems (SES). In applying these frameworks, attention must be given to the scale of analysis and to the effects of context. In addition to the frameworks there are four substantial research literatures providing theory and empirical analysis of how drivers place stress on the environment: a macrocomparative tradition, work on household energy consumption, land change science, and research on commons.

The historical dynamics surrounding land tenure transitions suggest a strategy for reform. Colonial regimes stripped indigenous peoples of most rights to land. Newly independent states restored these rights for some smallholders through land reforms. Later, neo-liberal regimes made secure titles more expensive, and, in so doing, made insecure land tenure more pervasive. Spots of secure land tenure did emerge when indigenous groups, with outside support, resisted efforts by powerful outsiders to expropriate indigenous homelands. Because insecure land tenure persists in most forested rural areas, a focus on afforestation in deforested areas, where earlier episodes of reform secured smallholder land tenure, offers a promising direction for future PES and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) efforts.},

In particular, there has been a rise of voluntary sustainability standards in an attempt to manage social and environmental impacts of global supply chains. We analyze the large spectrum of interactions between private, public, and civil society actors around voluntary sustainability standards, primarily for tropical agriculture and forestry. This review uncovers a policy ecosystem dominated by a proliferation of standards that complement, substitute, or compete against each other, with coordination mechanisms beginning to arise. Contrary to widely held views, interactions between governments, NGOs, and private companies surrounding the adoption of sustainable practices are not generally antagonistic, and public and private environmental governance regimes rarely operate independently. The influence of these interactions on the effectiveness of sustainability standards needs more attention. Better understanding how private regulations interact with the policy ecosystem will help design more effective interventions.

Four insights from contemporary SES literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c) systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored. Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.

	abstract = {Present trends of urbanization are accompanied by increasing demographic and economic shrinkage of rural regions. In countries such as Japan, these rural regions trail behind metropolitan counterparts according to GDP, the conventional measure used to guide governmental policies. Yet, past research suggests that these regions may be undervalued. Further, the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), largely only used at the national level, may be able to capture aspects previously missed. As such, our study attempts to highlight the wealth of rural regions by comparing the inclusive wealth of Sado Island and Japan between 1990 and 2014. Minor methodological modifications were made according to data availability at the local level and to improve the accuracy of human capital estimations. Results captured the ongoing shrinkage of Sado and demonstrate the distinct potential of the IWI as a stock measure. Sado‚Äôs per capita wealth was about 10\% lower than the national averages, but its natural capital was about threefold national averages. Supplementary estimations of the natural capital of fisheries and cultivated forests suggest that inclusion of additional factors in the evaluation would further increase the relative valuation of rural regions. We discuss implications of our estimations for wellbeing, and conclude with a critical appraisal of the IWI calculation towards policy implementation of the index.},

These weights, or shadow prices, can be constructed in theory by looking prospectively at future social profits that the capital in question is expected to yield. In practice, however, both backward- and forward-looking shadow prices are used. This study confirms that these two approaches are theoretically equivalent under strong assumptions and reviews how and why the two approaches are taken. The two approaches are then applied to renewable energy capital (REC), which has rarely been done in either produced or natural capital accounting and sustainability assessments. Renewable energy capital provides an ideal example with which to compare the two approaches, as it is a class of produced capital that substitutes both produced and natural capital. The numerical results of both approaches demonstrate that renewable energy capital starts to account for as large a share as natural capital does, if not produced capital or inclusive wealth, in those countries where natural capital is poorly endowed and investment in renewable energy capital has been witnessed.},

In particular, for ecosystems and socioeconomic systems, much interest is focused on broad scale features such as diversity and resiliency, while evolution operates most powerfully at the level of individual agents. Understanding the evolution and development of complex adaptive systems thus involves understanding how cooperation, coalitions and networks of interaction emerge from individual behaviors and feed back to influence those behaviors.

	abstract = {Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives‚Äîeither economic or social norms, or both‚Äîcan achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.},

	abstract = {Abstract Decision-makers often seek to design policies that support sustainable development. Prospective evaluations of how effectively such policies are likely to meet sustainability goals have nonetheless remained challenging. Evaluating policies against sustainability goals can be facilitated through the inclusive wealth framework, which characterizes development in terms of the value to society of its underlying capital assets, and defines development to be potentially sustainable if that value does not decline over time. The inclusive wealth approach has been developed at a theoretical level and applied to retrospective evaluations. Here, we apply inclusive wealth theory to prospective policy evaluation coupled with dynamic simulation modeling, using a case of electricity infrastructure policies in oil-exporting countries. To demonstrate the prospective evaluation, we analyze investment policies in non-fossil electricity capacity in terms of their forecast impact on several dimensions of inclusive wealth. Illustrative results show that investing in non-fossil capacity in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait can increase components of the countries' inclusive wealth, though the impacts depend on future uncertainties. In contrast, comparable components of the UAE's net inclusive wealth decline under similar investment policies. Finally, including human capital improvements in estimates of inclusive wealth substantially increases its value, though the amount varies across the countries.},

	abstract = {In 1992 PNAS presented a Special Feature with 22 contributions from a colloquium entitled ‚ÄúIndustrial Ecology,‚Äù held at the National Academy of Sciences of the United States in Washington, DC (1). In these articles Industrial Ecology was presented as an approach to understand and ultimately optimize the total material cycles of industrial processes (2).

This PNAS issue presents the second Special Feature on Industrial Ecology, offering the opportunity to reflect on the original goals and approaches and to compare them with Industrial Ecology‚Äôs achievements and its pertinent role within sustainability science.

The motivation to promote a new field as originally expressed in the contributions of the 1992 Special Feature is soberingly topical (3, 4): ( i ) the recognition that human alterations of the Earth System are progressing at an unprecedented pace; ( ii ) the insight that humankind has become a planetary force; and ( iii ) advocacy for a real-world sustainability transition that would be as fundamental as the industrial revolution of the 18th century.

Since the first Special Feature in 1992, the pace of growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, material use, and energy use has not slowed down or stopped, but rather has accelerated, especially after the year 2000 (5‚áì‚Äì7). Human-induced alterations of the Earth System have reached such a scale (8, 9) that a new term for the current geological epoch, the Anthropocene, was proposed (10). Climate-sensitive tipping elements of the Earth System have been detected and described (11). Those tipping elements (such as the Indian monsoon, the Amazon rainforest, or the Greenland Ice Sheet) have been stable since the beginning of the Holocene but have the potential to irreversibly flip into fundamentally different regimes once triggered by a global mean temperature above certain thresholds. Some of those thresholds appear to be within the reach ‚Ä¶

Here we reveal a strong similarity between patterns of inequality in nature and society, hinting at fundamen- tal unifying mechanisms. We show that chance alone will drive 1\% or less of the community to dominate 50\% of all resources in situations where gains and losses are multiplicative, as in returns on assets or growth rates of populations. Key mechanisms that counteract such hyperdominance include natural enemies in nature and wealth-equalizing institutions in society. However, historical research of European developments over the past millennium suggests that such institutions become ineffective in times of societal upscaling. A corollary is that in a globalizing world, wealth will inevitably be appropriated by a very small fraction of the population unless effective wealth-equalizing institutions emerge at the global level.},

Concurrently, the theory shows that by poverty we should mean a low level of wealth, not income, and that the distribution of well-being ought to be judged in terms of the distribution of wealth, not income or education or the many indicators that are currently in use. I show that the concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of assets and the idea of investment well beyond conventional usage.

Systems linking people and nature, known as social-ecological systems, are increasingly understood as complex adaptive systems. Essential features of these complex adaptive systems - such as nonlinear feedbacks, strategic interactions, individual and spatial heterogeneity, and varying time scales - pose substantial challenges for modeling. However, ignoring these characteristics can distort our picture of how these systems work, causing policies to be less effective or even counterproductive. In this paper we present recent developments in modeling social-ecological systems, illustrate some of these challenges with examples related to coral reefs and grasslands, and identify the implications for economic and policy analysis.

First, the ‚Äòreformist‚Äô position, which focuses on firms pursuing green eco-innovations and consumers buying eco-efficient products, represents the political and academic orthodoxy. Second, the ‚Äòrevolutionary‚Äô position, which is a radical critique of the mainstream, advocates the abolishment of capitalism, materialism, and consumerism, and promotes values such as frugality, sufficiency, and localism. We find this dichotomous debate problematic, because it is intellectually stifling and politically conservative (in its outcomes). To move beyond this dichotomy, we propose a third position, ‚Äòreconfiguration‚Äô, which focuses on transitions in socio-technical systems and daily life practices and accommodates new conceptual frameworks. For each of the three positions, we discuss: (1) the scale and type of change, (2) views on consumption and production in exemplary approaches, (3) underlying theoretical, epistemological and normative orientations, (4) policy implications, and (5) critical appraisal. The conclusion compares the three positions, provides arguments for the fruitfulness of the reconfiguration-position and offers four critical reflections about future Sustainable Consumption and Production research agendas.},

My aim is to conceptualize power using social science theory and to demonstrate why and how the concept of power can complement resilience studies and other analyses of social-ecological interaction. Social power as a scientific concept refers to the ability to influence both conduct and context. These two dimensions of power (conduct and context) can be observed by differentiating between various sources of power, including, for example, technology or mental power. The relevance of the conceptualization of power presented here is illustrated with the example of fire as a source of social-ecological power. I conclude by discussing how attention to power can help to address issues of social justice and responsibility in social-ecological interactions.]},

The paper was also at times disjointed which probably comes through in my notes on the paper.
The treatment of institutional theory was poor. The only time institutions were mentioned was in the box on ‚ÄúThe Grapes of Wrath‚Äù. I think the theory development might have been improved by treating structure as institutions and looking the ability of actors to change institutions. They got around this however by talking about human power as both ‚Äúconduct shaping‚Äù and ‚Äúcontext shaping‚Äù. I took this to mean that conduct shaping was direct power over other others (human and non-human) and context shaping was the ability to influence institutions broadly defined as rules, norms, culture and beliefs. I think this fits into the three faces of power described by Luke‚Äôs, where the first face is more directly conduct shaping and the second two are context shaping.
One very useful insight I gained from the paper (though it was not explicitly articulated) is an interesting link between power as exercised through institutions and power as exercised through negotiation. This came out of Boonstra‚Äôs discussion: ‚ÄúThese conditions include social structures (Merton 1938) and also social events, which refer to specific situated actions and interactions in time and place (Reed 2013).‚Äù Social structures constrain and shape human behavior over time whereas social events are distinct moments where a social interaction may have an unexpected outcome (one party may have superior negotiating skills for example). Critically the outcomes of social events can have future impacts I presume on both future actions of actors but maybe even on institutional structures. To link back to the three faces of power, social events and negotiation fit within the first face of power but social structure fits with the 2nd and 3rd That said there is a certain recursiveness to the situation because power structures set up in the 3rd face undermine the ability of less powerful actors to negotiate in the 1st face due to changes in understanding of self-efficacy.
Boonstra‚Äôs discussion of the relationship of structure and agency to power is cogent: ‚Äúagency together with structures and events constitute social power: ‚ÄòPower structures [and events] enable and constrain human agency, just as the exercise of power by agents produce and reproduce power structures [and events]‚Äô (Raik, et al. 2008:736)‚Äù. ‚ÄòSocial power‚Äô he argues is made up of both agent-centered and structural power.
In the discussion of the human use of fire as a type of power, the author includes a STS/Latour approach that brings non-humans as actors into discussions of power and social processes. I was unconvinced by how helpful this theoretical framing was to the rest of the work.
The empirical part of the paper is taken from Goudsblom‚Äôs work on how the acquisition of new sources of energy based on firepower transformed the ways in which people and nature interrelated. Goudsblom (2001) argues that ‚Äúthere seem to be two types of human behavior that are resilient: changes in behavior that generate and consolidate power (see also Giddens 1984), and behavior that adapts to this generation and consolidation of power (see also Scott 1985, 1990, 2009).‚Äù
Boonstra has an interesting conclusion on assigning responsibility for damage in social ecological interactions. In SES its often difficult to assign responsibility for negative outcomes to specific people because it often proved unfeasible to identify causal relations between individual actions and undesirable collective outcomes. But understanding the context shaping rather than explicitly conduct shaping side of power links people at more distant scales if not through direct liability though social connections to negative outcomes. Further incorporating the context shaping notion of power into SES studies helps to overcome the ‚Äúvulnerability of a complex adaptive systems perspective, or any type of systems thinking‚Äù which ‚Äúexplains inequality, fairness, and unsustainability as systemic properties and mechanisms‚Äù (e.g. some humans are more responsible than others for the ecological degradation during the ‚Äòanthropocene‚Äô.
Relevance to our work: I think it gives a useful way of thinking about negotiation theory as part of winning in the first face of power. But in these ‚Äúevent based‚Äù negotiations there are moments where longer-term institutional structures that shape other dimensions of power can be put in place. 
The reliance on historical examples lends further evidence to the need to approach the study of power from a longer perspective in order to understand its more complex dimensions. },

Therefore, changes in roles can be indicative of changes in the broader social fabric. They can provide new opportunities for multi-actor collaboration to deal with societal challenges, like implementing sustainability practices, forming an important part of transitions. The article asks the following question: ‚ÄúWhat is the potential of the concept of roles for describing and understanding the interaction and relations of actors in sustainability transitions and their governance?‚Äù
¬†
The authors begin with a literature overview of transition research. They focus on the key points of convergence of¬† varying streams within this field and their treatment of actors and agency. ¬†From their review of roles theories, they establish that the concept of roles allows for a more systematic description and analysis of the interaction and relations between actors, which can be made productive for analyzing current and historical transitions.
¬†
The article provides three main insights for transition research:

A single role always relates to one or more other roles and that a change in one has consequences for the others. This implies two distinct objects of analysis: the single role and a role constellation. The latter term refers to webs of roles, which interact, interrelate and co-evolve with one another. While an analysis of the single role provides insights into its substance, a focus on the role constellation highlights the relations between different roles.
In line with the focus of transition research on change, the authors suggest distinguishing between two temporal aspects of the analysis. Both single roles and role constellations can be analyzed either at a specific point in time as a temporary stabilization or over time focusing on how these change. 
The authors propose to consider the flexible use of roles as a particular form of transition governance intervention, suggesting that roles can be used not only explicitly, but also purposefully in interactions with other actors as acts of transition governance. It is through the creation and use of new roles or by breaking down and altering existing ones that role change prompts changes in collective processes and alters dominant institutional constellations. Therefore, we propose to consider the flexible use of roles as a particular form of transition governance intervention.

Wittmayer et al. illustrate their argument by introducing an ethnographic study in the neighbourhood of Rotterdam-Carnisse. They organized a transition management process of ‚Äúproblem framing, visioning and pathway development and facilitated actual experimentation‚Äù to institute alternative, sustainable ideas, practices and social relations in the neighborhood. Their case is based on interviews, participant observation, informal interactions on numerous occasions, document reviews, field-notes and the organisation and facilitation of seven deliberative meetings and six action-oriented meetings in the period from 2010 to 2015.¬†¬† 
¬†
Paper cites the Fischer and Newig paper AND BUT does a much better job on the topic of actors in sustainability transitions.¬† Its better theorized than the Fischer and Newig paper. While the paper does not explicitly link the concept of roles to a more theoretical discussion of the way agency embedded in different roles can change structure, the paper clearly wrestles with this anyway.¬†
¬†
Relevance to project: Roles, relations, and interactions, all have aspects of power. The paper talk a bit about constructing social roles that place the responsibility of implementing sustainable practices in the hands of citizens rather than institutions. In this context, it is up to the citizen to participate in their communities, actively working toward transitions. This relates to the relationship between power and empowerment. It also discusses the importance of accounting for the social construction of roles, i.e. the powerful vs. the powerless, in manufacturing transitions},

This book should be required reading for all sustainability scientists I feel. 
To test the three faces of power argument laid out in Lukes, 1974 (above) in a field setting using a historical approach he focuses on a coal mining town in Appalachia, Clear Fork Valley, between 1890 and the 1980s.
Gaventa argues that a historical approach to studying the three faces of power is the appropriate method to understand the mechanisms undergirding each face. In particular, it will help to overcome the methodological deficiencies of Dahl et al who focus on the first face of power. In contrast the historical method by allowing the researcher to study the mechanisms of power over time that lead to non-participation and non-action can get at the existence and mechanisms of the 2nd and 3rd faces of power. In addition, the moments of rebellion that did take place over the historical period studied and the quelling of collective action by elites lead further insights into the mechanisms of the 3 faces of power and the ways in which they are intertwined.
Rough summary of book: From my own perspective on the book, the first face of power (i.e. more resources to belonging to group A to control group B) seems to be a prerequisite for setting up the 2nd and 3rd In the case of the Clear Fork Valley, the powerful party (A) was the American Association Ltd‚Äîa group of British investors who quietly bought up land from the ‚Äúmountain men‚Äù residents during the 1890s before they understood the value of the coal and other minerals underneath. The residents of the county and adjoining counties who worked for the mine slowly lost all of their economic autonomy as all land resources in the area belonged to the coal company. After establishing economic power over the miners by possessing more resources than the minors (in this case mostly natural capital), the coal company worked to both change institutions to further exclude the minors attempts to confront their oppressors. Using the first face of power (resources) they installed their own people in elected positions in the country. Then these people created rules that benefited the mine owners over the workers. They also refused to enforce other rules in law that would have benefited them‚Äîsetting up the second face of power to benefit the mine owners. Finally, through media and company owned churches, the company used the 3rd face of power to create a culture and belief system that the inequities in the system were natural so workers would not see that they even had reason for grievances.
Through the chapters of the book one of the more interesting points that emerge is the interrelationship between the three faces of power. At one point when the actual power A has over B erodes due to macro-economic changes in the price of coal, the company is able to maintain control because the 2nd and 3rd face are still firmly entrenched in the region. Then when the price of coal goes back up, they reestablish the 1st face of power and then engage again in strengthening the 2nd and 3rd in a continual process. Later in the book the mineworkers strike and a consciousness emerges that the mineworkers have real grievances against the coal company that should be remedied. When this happens the 3rd face of power between the coal company and the mineworkers diminishes. In response, the coal company uses its 1st and 2nd faces of power to rebuild the 3rd face and maintain their position of power. Some of their responses include: manipulating local media, using law enforcement to keep union organizers out, creating fake news and alternative facts, using brute force violence, and using the church to breed distrust on the part of the minors in union values.
Some key points from the books conclusion:
‚ÄúOnce patterns of prevalence had been established within the decision-making arenas, power cold be wielded more readily over the decision-making agenda itself. Since the formative historical moment, conflict over matters of inequality has been contained primarily within the second and third dimensional arenas of power.‚Äù (pp. 253).
‚Äúthe total impact of a power relationship is more than the sum of its parts. Power serves to create power. Powerlessness serves to re-enforce powerlessness. Power relationships, once established, are self-sustaining. Quiescence in the face of inequalities may be understood only in terms of inertia of the situation. For this reason, power in a given community can never be understood simply by observation at a given point in time. Historical investigation must occur to discover whether routines of non-conflict have been shaped, and, if so, how they are maintained.‚Äù (pp. 256).
‚ÄúThe dimensions of power say something not only about how quiescence is maintained, but also about the aspects of powerlessness which must be overcome to the development of successful protest‚Äù. (pp. 257).
This goes back to the model he presents at the beginning of the book.
Successful protest: 1. Issue and action formulation; 2. Mobilization, locate and overcome barriers to entry in decision making arenas. 3. Mobilize resources for a clearly conceived interest in an open arena.
‚ÄúWhat for the powerless are obstacles to be overcome in the raising of issues, for the powerful are mechanisms for maintaining the status quo. Rebellion, to be successful, must both confront power and overcome the accumulated effects of powerlessness.‚Äù (pp. 258).
Another important issue raised in the conclusion are levels and social distance. It was even easier for the coal company headquartered in London to exploit the coalminers for generations because they were even more difficult to identify as the source of the coalminers problems. ¬†¬†
The final most general point made in the conclusion is that if democracy is not functioning at the local level in the US, then despite the fact that democracy at the national level seems to represent diverse interests, if the national level is built from local components that actual in sum represent the interests of the powerful than ‚Äúdemocracy of the few will continue to be legitimated by a prevailing belief in the apathy of ignorance of the many‚Äù. (pp. 260).
‚Äútheorists and practitioners of democracy should turn their energies to considering how the power relationships of contemporary society are to be altered if the social and economic depravations of the people within it are to be overcome.‚Äù (pp. 261).
Relevance to our project: 
The basis of the 1st face of power is resources. In the book the main resource is natural capital (land and control over minerals) but there are other resources that undergird the 1st face including manufactured capital (the tools needed to exploit the coal) and knowledge capital (the knowledge that the land has value in the first place allowed the company to buy it at rock bottom prices from the more or less subsistence farmers who just felt they could move on to other land).
The 2nd and 3rd faces of power were derived from the 1st face as the coal company used their resources to create institutions which altered the social capital in the community constantly strengthening the social capital of the company and undermining the ability of the miners to build social capital.
I think that this very much supports the idea that a key root of power is ownership over resources. But this just gets at the first face. The 2nd and 3rd faces of power are more complicated and are produced by actors in the system through changes to rules and norms (face 2) and changes to culture and beliefs (face 3).}

All three are epistemologically rooted in an evolutionary understanding of socio-technical change. While these approaches are appropriate to understand market-driven processes of change, they may be deficient as analytical tools for exploring and designing processes of purposive societal transformation. In particular, we argue that the evolutionary mechanism of selection is the key to introducing the strong directionality required for purposive transformative change. In all three innovation theories, we find that the prime selection environment is constituted by the market and, thus, normative societal goals like sustainability are sidelined. Consequently, selection is depoliticised and neither strong directionality nor incumbent regime destabilisation are societally steered. Finally, we offer an analytical framework that builds upon a more political conception of selection and retention and calls for new political institutions to make normatively guided selections. Institutions for transformative innovation need to improve the capacities of complex societies to make binding decisions in politically contested fields.},

	abstract = {This paper presents insights and action proposals to better harness technological innovation for sustainable development. We begin with three key insights from scholarship and practice. First, technological innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions operating simultaneously from local to global scales. Barriers arise at all stages of innovation, from the invention of a technology through its selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Second, learning from past efforts to mobilize innovation for sustainable development can be greatly improved through structured cross-sectoral comparisons that recognize the socio-technical nature of innovation systems. Third, current institutions (rules, norms, and incentives) shaping technological innovation are often not aligned toward the goals of sustainable development because impoverished, marginalized, and unborn populations too often lack the economic and political power to shape innovation systems to meet their needs. However, these institutions can be reformed, and many actors have the power to do so through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and financing. We conclude with three practice-oriented recommendations to further realize the potential of innovation for sustainable development: (i) channels for regularized learning across domains of practice should be established; (ii) measures that systematically take into account the interests of underserved populations throughout the innovation process should be developed; and (iii) institutions should be reformed to reorient innovation systems toward sustainable development and ensure that all innovation stages and scales are considered at the outset.},

However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

We carried out a multicountry comparative analysis of natural resource management programs conducted under the auspices of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. We discovered six distinctive kinds of boundary work contributing to the successes of those programs‚Äîa greater variety than has been documented in previous studies. We argue that these different kinds of boundary work can be understood as a dual response to the different uses for which the results of specific research programs are intended, and the different sources of knowledge drawn on by those programs. We show that these distinctive kinds of boundary work require distinctive strategies to organize them effectively. Especially important are arrangements regarding participation of stakeholders, accountability in governance, and the use of ‚Äúboundary objects.‚Äù We conclude that improving the ability of research programs to produce useful knowledge for sustainable development will require both greater and differentiated support for multiple forms of boundary work.},

	abstract = {Growing concerns over climate change and the potential for large damages due to nonlinear processes underscore the need for a meaningful sustainability assessment of an economy. Economists have developed rigorous approaches to conceptualizing sustainability based on the paradigm of weak sustainability, which relies on extensive substitution among reproducible capital, renewable resources, and exhaustible natural resources. In contrast, strong sustainability emphasizes physical limits to this substitution and the importance of maintaining the resilience of normally functioning biophysical processes. Recent progress in resource and environmental economics has demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating strong sustainability features, including tipping points, uncertainties, and resilience, to assess efficiency and optimal policies. Given that weak sustainability and intertemporal efficiency share a welfare theoretic foundation, we ask: To what extent can these approaches be applied to evaluate sustainability? We highlight recent work on assessing sustainability in imperfect economies and dynamic models of intertemporal welfare that embed strong sustainability features.},

This study integrates theory on power with the institutional analysis and design (IAD) framework in order to provide a conceptual framework for examining power that is not captured through the IAD‚Äôs focus on action situations. We examined the use of collaboration in CPR governance contexts characterized by significant power imbalances. Two Canadian collaborative processes that involve large energy industry interests were studied. We assessed the ability of these collaborative processes to address social and environmental goals. Results revealed significant hidden power dynamics related to inaction and non-decisions. Collaboration was unable to produce progressive outcomes because of i) the restriction of the collaborative agenda by powerful actors; ii) selective enforcement of rules; and; iii) a broader neoliberal context that inherently favoured increasing resource extraction. These findings indicate that the achievement of progressive social and environmental outcomes through collaboration is constrained where powerful resource industries are present as participants.},

However, the world remains stuck with practices and modes of thinking that were developed in the Holocene ‚Äì the epoch of around 12,000 years of unusual stability in the Earth system, toward the end of which modern institutions such as states and capitalist markets arose. These institutions persist despite their potentially catastrophic failure to respond to the challenges of the Anthropocene, foremost among them a rapidly changing climate and accelerating biodiversity loss. The pathological trajectories of these institutions need to be disrupted by advancing ecological reflexivity: the capacity of structures, systems, and sets of ideas to question their own core commitments, and if necessary change themselves, while listening and responding effectively to signals from the Earth system. This book envisages a world in which humans are no longer estranged from the Earth system but engage with it in a more productive relationship. We can still pursue democracy, social justice, and sustainability ‚Äì but not as before. In future, all politics should be first and foremost a politics of the Anthropocene. The arguments are developed in the context of issues such as climate change, biodiversity, and global efforts to address sustainability.},

"The opposite of path dependency is reflexivity, the capacity of structures, systems, and ideas to question their own core commitments, and if necessary change themselves, not just do different things. The main requirement of governance in the Anthropocene is ecological reflexivity, which requires listening and responding effectively to signals from the Earth system, and foresight to anticipate potentially catastrophic changes. Ecological reflexivity fights pathological path dependencies. More effective deliberative and democratic practices can help. However, no fixed model of governance is appropriate in an ever-changing Earth system. Instead, this chapter shows how to think about building the capacity of governance to change, which is much more important than any specific model. The challenge is to develop governance capacities that have never been fully demonstrated before.¬†},

A wide gap separates this processual understanding of empowerment from the more instrumentalist forms of advocacy which have required the measurement and quantification of empowerment. The ability to exercise choice incorporates three inter-related dimensions: resources (defined broadly to include not only access, but also future claims, to both material and human and social resources); agency (including processes of decision making, as well as less measurable manifestations of agency such as negotiation, deception and manipulation); and achievements (well-being outcomes). A number of studies of women's empowerment are analysed to make some important methodological points about the measurement of empowerment. The paper argues that these three dimensions of choice are indivisible in determining the meaning of an indicator and hence its validity as a measure of empowerment. The notion of choice is further qualified by referring to the conditions of choice, its content and consequences. These qualifications represent an attempt to incorporate the structural parameters of individual choice in the analysis of women's empowerment.},

We examine how and why elements of organizational design, objectives, and the evolving political landscape have interacted and changed, with a view of informing the design and conduct of future processes. We find that the historical genesis of GEAs is closely connected to the emergence of environmental multilateralism. However, the prevailing conditions and assumptions which originally gave rise to the GEA concept have changed significantly over time, giving rise to an increasing demand for a focus on response options and policies. We also find that the epistemic and process complexity of GEAs has increased substantially, without a corresponding expansion in the magnitude and composition of GEA management teams. We suggest that developing analytical capacities for policy assessment as well as ensuring sufficient resources and tools to manage increasingly complex GEAs is essential to ensure their future relevance and success.

	abstract = {"Who really creates wealth in our world? And how do we decide the value of what they do? At the heart of today's financial and economic crisis is a problem hiding in plain sight. In modern capitalism, value-extraction is rewarded more highly than value-creation: the productive process that drives a healthy economy and society. From companies driven solely to maximize shareholder value to astronomically high prices of medicines justified through big pharma's 'value pricing', we misidentify taking with making, and have lost sight of what value really means. Once a central plank of economic thought, this concept of value--what it is, why it matters to us--is simply no longer discussed. Yet, argues Mariana Mazzucato in this penetrating and passionate new book, if we are to reform capitalism--radically to transform an increasingly sick system rather than continue feeding it--we urgently need to rethink where wealth comes from. Which activities create it, which extract it, which destroy it? Answers to these questions are key if we want to replace the current parasitic system with a type of capitalism that is more sustainable, more symbiotic - that works for us all. The Value of Everything will reignite a long-needed debate about the kind of world we really want to live in"--Publisher's description.},

Given that climate change is both generated and experienced internationally, effective global governance is imperative for its resolution; yet, current modes of global governance have so far failed to provide effective responses. Hayley Stevenson and John Dryzek argue that legitimacy, accountability, deliberation and democracy are not just intrinsically important, but also increase the chances of successful collective action. Spanning topics of multilateral diplomacy, networked governance, representation, accountability, protest and participation, this book charts the failures and successes of global climate governance to offer fresh proposals for a deliberative system which would enable meaningful communication, inclusion of all affected interests, accountability and effectiveness in dealing with climate change; one of the most vexing issues of our time"-- Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {A contemporary challenge is inequality. This paper illustrates why ideas matter, and how they can change over time. Inequalities are reinforced when they are taken for granted. But this can be disrupted when marginalised people gain self-esteem; challenge hitherto unquestioned inequalities; and gain confidence in the possibility of social change. Slowly and incrementally, social mobilisation can catalyse greater government commitment to socially inclusive economic growth. This is illustrated with ethnographic research from Latin America, where income inequality has recently declined. Clearly, however, no single paper can provide a comprehensive account of political change in an incredibly diverse region. By highlighting some ways in which ideas matter (and the limitations of alternative hypotheses about increased fiscal space and democratisation), this paper merely seeks to persuade political economists to go beyond ‚Äòincentives‚Äô. Future efforts to tackle inequality might harness the power of ideas: tackling ‚Äònorm perceptions‚Äô (beliefs about what others think and do); publicising positive deviance; and strengthening social movements.},

¬†
1. Inequality is driven by powerful actors setting rules in US much more than by technological change
2. Money and power are self enforcing... wealth begets power and power begets wealth
¬†
"American inequality didn‚Äôt just happen. It was created. ‚Ä¶The forces that have been at play in creating these outcomes are self-reinforcing.¬†By understanding the origins of inequality, we can better grasp the costs and benefits of reducing it. The simple thesis of this chapter is that even though market forces help shape the degree of inequality, government policies shape those market forces. Much of the inequality that exists today is a result of government policy, both what the government does, and what it does not do." (page 28)
¬†

emphasis on the ways that Governments encourage, permit, and decline to limit or tax, ‚Äúrent-seeking income.‚Äù
Rent-seeking income provides a much higher ROI¬† income from wages or the production of goods and services. This is because its taxed very differnetly than wages or manifactured goods. 

¬†
Our hypothesis is that market forces are real, but that they are shaped by political processes. Markets are shaped by laws, regulations, and institutions. Every law, every regulation, every institutional arrangement has distributive consequences‚Äîand the way we have been shaping America‚Äôs market economy works to the advantage of those at the top and to the disadvantage of the rest. (page 52)
¬†
‚Ä¶Imagine, for a moment, what the world would be like if there was free mobility of labour, but no mobility of capital. Countries would compete to attract workers. They would promise good schools and a good environment, as well as low taxes on workers. This could be financed by high taxes on capital. But that‚Äôs not the world we live in, and that‚Äôs partly because the 1 percent doesn‚Äôt want it to be that way. (page 61)
In the thirty years prior to the publication of his book, the percentage of U.S. wage earners belonging to a labour union dropped by 40\%, from 20.1\% overall to 11.9\%.
"The more divided a society becomes in terms of wealth, the more reluctant the wealthy are to spend money on common needs. The rich don‚Äôt need to rely on government for parks or education or medical care or personal security. They can buy all these things for themselves." page 93
Negative Impacts of Inequality
1.Worker pschychology
2. Consumerism and trying to be like the top 1\% or the top 0.01\% -- "not just an individals absiolute income, but his income relative to that of others" (104)
3. Endangers the foundations of democracy... "‚Ä¶a process of disempowerment, disillusionment, and disenfranchisement that produces low voter turnout, a system in which electoral success requires heavy investments, and in which those with money have made political investments that have reaped large rewards‚Äîoften greater than the returns they have reaped on their other investments. " ... leads to decrease in public trust....
¬†
Growing inequality, combined with a flawed system of campaign finance, risks turning America‚Äôs legal system into a travesty of justice. Some may still call it the ‚Äúrule of law,‚Äù but in today‚Äôs America the proud claim of ‚Äújustice for all‚Äù is being replaced by the more modest claim of ‚Äújustice for those who can afford it.‚Äù And the number of people who can afford it is rapidly diminishing" (page 206)
"There is an alternative set of policies and institutional arrangements that holds out the promise of not only better and more stable growth, but also of a more equitable sharing of the benefits of that growth." (p 240)

From the biology of the deep ocean to the chemistry of the stratosphere, and almost everywhere in between, human actions have led to ecological alterations great and small. While our species has exerted environmental impacts, occasionally substantial ones since the Paleolithic, never before has humankind had such an impact on the Earth. A massive uncontrolled experiment is underway. Where it might lead, no one can yet say. The reasons behind this environmental tumult are sometimes obvious and sometimes obscure. This book highlights the role of the modern energy system and the economic growth it has fostered, but pays heed as well to population growth, urbanization, migration, the Cold War, and environmentalisms, among other trends and phenomena that affected the global environment. The pace of indicators such as energy use, population growth, species extinctions, fresh water use, carbon dioxide emissions, and many more has led some students of environmental change to label the period after 1950 as The Great Acceleration. This book argues that concept is valid. In addition, it argues that the scale and scope of environmental change have altered basic biogeochemical cycles to the point where the Earth has entered a new period in its history: the Anthropocene. Humankind, too, has entered a new age in which it rivals natural forces in shaping the Earth, its biota, its climate, and its prospects."--Provided by publisher.},

The guidelines are arranged under three headings: foundational, design and construction, and supporting sustainability in the long term. Under foundational, we address the need for co-operation with end users of decision-support resources, the contribution these resources can make to the formation of thriving communities of practice, and the match between the different types of decision support and user needs. Under design and construction, we point to the risk that policy settings will change over the multiple years required to build and publish complex decision-support resources, reducing the relevance of the final product. We discuss the need for innovative approaches to ensure visibility, credibility and hence uptake. Developers should be mindful of the requirements, resources and capabilities of potential users at all points in the design and build. We also suggest that decision-support resources may be transferable between sectors and locations, but the motivation should be around achieving excellence, and not just cost savings. Under supporting sustainability in the long term, we stress the need for evaluation and comparative studies of performance, leading to carefully documented updating and improvement of decision-support resources. Finally, in the conclusions, we look to the future. Can decision-support resources evolve successfully to meet the information and guidance requirements of the increasingly sophisticated adaptation practitioner community?},

	abstract = {Urban consumption patterns and lifestyles are increasingly important for the sustainability of cities today and in the future. However, considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behaviour and lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production and consumption-based approaches, particularly in the ‚Äúdemand‚Äù areas of mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption and production patterns in cities, research needs to be transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change initiatives, citizen groups and informal sector representatives. We present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through three empirical case studies in cities which take an integrative approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for the analysis of technological innovation processes in transnational contexts. By drawing on existing innovation system concepts and recent elaborations on the globalization of innovation, we develop a multi-scalar conceptualization of innovation systems. Two key mechanisms are introduced and elaborated: the generation of resources in multi-locational subsystems and the establishment of structural couplings among them in a global innovation system (GIS). Based on this conceptualization, we introduce a typology of four generic GIS configurations, building on the innovation mode and valuation system in different industry types. The analytical framework is illustrated with insights from four emerging clean-tech industries. We state that a comprehensive GIS perspective is instrumental for developing a more explanatory stance in the innovation system literature and developing policy interventions that reflect the increasing spatial complexity in the innovation process.},

It is proposed here that qualitative classification be applied into climate change adaptation products, services, and systems to better guide research, policy, and practice with a clear terminology and analysis framework. This differentiation allows the pinpointing of critical challenges associated with the production and application of climate-relevant information, as well as the identification of suitable metrics to assess the impact of climate services.

However, despite the proliferation of forest certification over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness. Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia), we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence of air pollution by 31\%. It had no statistically significant impacts on fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4 km2 on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood dependence (by 33\%), respiratory infections (by 32\%) and malnutrition (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations of a potentially critical conservation policy.},

The supply chains driving land use change may also provide opportunities to halt deforestation. Market campaigns, moratoria, and certification schemes have been promoted as powerful tools to achieve conservation goals. Despite their promise, there have been few opportunities to rigorously quantify the ability of these nonstate, market-driven (NSMD) governance regimes to deliver conservation outcomes. This study analyzes the impacts of three NSMD governance systems that sought to end the conversion of natural forests to plantations in Chile at the start of the 21st century. Using a multilevel, panel dataset of land use changes in Chile, we identify the impact of participation within each of the governance regimes by implementing a series of matched difference-in-differences analyses. Taking advantage of the mosaic of different NSMD regimes adopted in Chile, we explore the relative effectiveness of different policies. NSMD governance regimes reduced deforestation on participating properties by 2‚Äì23\%. The NSMD governance regimes we studied included collaborative and confrontational strategies between environmental and industry stakeholders. We find that the more collaborative governance systems studied achieved better environmental performance than more confrontational approaches. Whereas many government conservation programs have targeted regions with little likelihood of conversion, we demonstrate that NSMD governance has the potential to alter behavior on high-deforestation properties.},

	abstract = {With a range of potential pathways to a sustainable future compatible with the Paris Agreement 1.5‚Äâ¬∞C target, scenario analysis has emerged as a key tool in studies of climate change mitigation and adaptation. A wide range of alternative scenarios have been created, and core amongst these are five socio-economic scenarios (Shared Socio-economic Pathways or SSPs) and four emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs). Whilst mitigation scenarios (the Shared Policy Assumptions, or SPAs) have been developed for each SSP-RCP combination, describing the actions necessary to match the climate pathway of the RCP, there has not yet been a systematic approach to address whether and how these actions can be enabled in practice. We present a novel and transferable framework to understand society‚Äôs capacity to achieve the 1.5‚Äâ¬∞C target, based on four participatory case studies using the SSP-RCP scenarios. The methodology builds on a framework for categorising different types of societal capitals and capacities and assessing their impact on the potential to implement different types of mitigation actions. All four case studies show that SSP1 has the highest potential to reach the target. Although environmental awareness is high in both SSP1 and SSP4, continued social inequalities in SSP4 restrict society‚Äôs capacity to transform, despite economic growth. In the two least environmentally-aware SSPs, SSP3 and SSP5, the transformation potential is low, but the view on capitals and capacities nonetheless helps identify opportunities for actors to develop and implement mitigation actions. The study highlights that techno-economic assessments of climate strategies need to be complemented by consideration of the critical role played by social and human capital, and by societal capacity to mobilise and create these capitals despite different socio-economic trends. These capitals and capacities are essential to enable the rapid innovation, behavioural change and international co-ordination needed to achieve the 1.5‚Äâ¬∞C target.},

Here is a quite extraordinary new article that links up a bunch of our concerns in novel (at least for me) ways, and coming from a very interesting set of sources.¬† See the quote below; the full paper is in Zotero‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúSocietal transformations are ultimately driven by different actors ‚Äìboth individuals or organisations representing different societal spheres
(governments, communities, market and third sector) ‚Äì who consciously or unconsciously act to change the state of human and natural
systems (O‚ÄôBrien, 2015, 2016; Avelino and Wittmayer, 2016). As these actors are embedded within societal structures (e.g. formal and informal
institutions, social networks, resource distribution), their capacities are manifest in the extent to which they are able to mobilise, create and change these structures (Giddens, 1979; Giddens, 1986) ‚Äì in terms of institutions, resources, networks etc. We therefore base our methodology on assessing two key sets of indicators:
1 Stocks of five types of capital: human, social, natural, manufactured and financial, with a focus on human and social capital because they underpin the potential for transformational societal change;
2 Four types of capacity that give actors the agency to mobilise, create and change the stocks of these five capitals: stewarding, unlocking, transforming, orchestrating.‚Äù
¬†
It would be great if you could give me your thoughts at some point on where the ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù arguments that are here associated with ‚Äúagency‚Äù ought to live in our review.¬†¬† (Interestingly, my ‚ÄúCrafting knowledge‚Ä¶‚Äù paper in PNAS ‚Äì that was the basis of my talk to the UMN/ASU/UNAM group on Thursday ‚Äì also emphasizes the importance of ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù, drawing on the work of my coauthors Lebel and van Kerkoff.
¬†
More generally, I‚Äôd be interested in your take on how this paper (eg. In the use of Giddens in the quote above) deals with structure / agency issues, and if that has something to teach us .¬† Or me.

	annote = {"Our methodology identifies the elements that ‚Äòenable‚Äô climate action in each SSP through an assessment of i) five capital stocks available for society to draw upon (human, social, natural, financial and manufactured capital), and ii) four types of agency capacities (stewarding, unlocking, transforming and orchestrating) through which actors are able to leverage these capitalsand enact change."},
	annote = {Thoughts on the paper (Harley)
Overall, this is a really cool paper in its efforts to combine a lot of different streams of research and bring them together in a way that analytically tackles how to bend the curve.¬†
At first I thought it fit well in the power section, but I actually don't think it fits very well anymore after thinking about it a lot. This is because it really fails to deal with where power or capacity comes from or how to grow it when power and capacity is maldistributed and the people with the power are driving the system in entirely unsustainable directions.¬†
¬†
My critique does not mean its not a valuable paper as it really does pull a lot of ideas together, but it would have been stronger perhaps if they thought about where the capacities come from, how they are grown when groups systematically lack them, and even how these capacities can overcome really deeply entrinched interests.¬† It is a really valuable contribution to the field, but its focus on overcoming entrinched power structures is somewhat burried, though it does show up. For example the fact that institutional change requires all four capacities makes sense to me, but it would be nice if they reflected more deeply on why this is.
¬†
Some high points of the paper;
"We employ the concept of capacities for understanding the abilities of actors in the scenarios to effectively mobilise, create and change capital stocks."

This seems to me the right take on what capacities ultimatly need to do--change the way stocks are built up or drawn down and who has access to control those stocks or the flows from those stocks.

The study demonstrates that social cost‚Äìbenefit analysis and damage-limiting strategies can be usefully extended to illuminate issues with major long-term consequences, as well as concerns such as potential tipping points, irreversibility, and hysteresis. A key finding is that, under a wide range of assumptions, the risk of GIS disintegration makes a small contribution to the optimal stringency of current policy or to the overall social cost of climate change. It finds that the cost of GIS disintegration adds less than 5\% to the social cost of carbon (SCC) under alternative discount rates and estimates of the GIS dynamics.},

Green transformations must be both 'top-down', involving elite alliances between states and business, but also 'bottom up', pushed by grassroots innovators and entrepreneurs, and part of wider mobilisations among civil society"--},

AGH Notes on this book:
Overall, they dont "theorize" what a pathway is at all so its not very helpful to our conceptual challenges. BUT there are some interesting insights see below.

They argue that was is often missed in calls for green transformations that rely on technology or putting a price on nature are the politics. "What is often missing, however, is attention to the politics that are inevitably implied by disruptive change of this nature: questions of institutional change and policy, as well as more profound shifts in political power. This is the starting point for this book".
Political questions include

what counts as green
what is to be transfomred
who is to do the transforming
whether traansformation as opposed to more incremental change is required


They emphasize the uniqueness of the sustainability transition. Some transition in the past¬† have had impacts on variables related to sustainability, none have¬† been¬† goal oriented around this issue.

Industrial Rev
End of slavery
rise of feminism


"none have¬† been about rending the economy and existing model of develpment more sustainable"
"The governance challenge of redirecting so many types of human activity across so many levels are staggering and quite posibly unprecedented, prompting calls to strengthen 'earth systems governance' and social science of transformation.
"Our focus on politics and broader questions of structural change suggest 'transformation' rather than 'transition' is the key term.
"Transformations are inevitably multiple and contested, as pathways interconnect and compete. Politics and power are important to how pathways are shaped, which pathways win out and why, and who benifits from them". 
One thing to note is that they think about a green transition (which is latently their intergenerational dimension because ostesnibly doing things today more green leaves resources for the future) and a justice transitions or a green and just transition which includes the poor today and future generations. But they do not touch on the capital assets/resources approach.
Greening is a process rather than an end state--things can always get more green according to them. This is a bit lame because there is no way to say that say we are green enough and now we should focus on say investing more in knowledge capital. There is very little traction for thinking about tradeoffs.
This is a weird argument: "Just as it is impossible to concieve of the end-point of the unfolding low-carbon transition, so previous transiformations did not start out with clear buleprints and plans tyhat were then rolled out, Rather they were the product of competition and interaction between a number of pathways, supported by diverse social actors with highly uneven political power." So the diffeerence is that a transition to SD maybe does not have an end point but we do at least have a sense of when we have done enough. Are we far enough away from tipping points that take the system into collapse? So this transition is unique becuase we at least should be able to say what is not enough. when we have not yet reached at least one end point.
Politics of pathways

end-points
markets vs state
knowledge underpinning them


Does the stakes of the challenge warrent "suspension of normal democratic procedures." --they argue no in a chapter by Stirling.¬† Intead they call for a 'slow race' that is respectful of inclkusion,¬† deliberation, deomocracy and justice (Leach and Scoones 2006)
Questions of whether wholesale transformations/deep trannsitions vs more discreet socio-technical transitions. Debate over what is needed.
Where is the starting point. Some¬† options

technology-led
marketized
stated led
citixen led


How to do it

individual behavior change
pricing of environmental externalities and ecosystem services
state restructuring
support for green industrial sectors
green innovation


-- all have different implications for who should be involved and who wins and who looses.

	abstract = {The need to adapt to climate change is now widely recognised as evidence of its impacts on social and natural systems grows and greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are framed within a ‚Äúpathways‚Äù metaphor to emphasise the need for robust decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such ‚Äúadaptation pathways‚Äù approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of ‚Äúadaptation pathways‚Äù that draws on ‚Äòpathways thinking‚Äô in the sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions constrain societal responses to change. This re-conceptualisation of adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of adaptation.},

	abstract = {This paper is motivated by a concern that adaptation and vulnerability research suffer from an under-theorization of the political mechanisms of social change and the processes that serve to reproduce vulnerability over time and space. We argue that adaptation is a socio-political process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes. We propose that applying concepts of subjectivity, knowledges and authority to the analysis of adaptation focuses attention on this socio-political process. Drawing from vulnerability, adaptation, political ecology and social theory literatures, we explain how power is reproduced or contested in adaptation practice through these three concepts. We assert that climate change adaptation processes have the potential to constitute as well as contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge, thereby opening up or closing down space for transformational adaptation. We expand on this assertion through four key propositions about how adaptation processes can be understood and outline an emergent empirical research agenda, which aims to explicitly examine these propositions in specific social and environmental contexts. We describe how the articles in this special issue are contributing to this nascent research agenda, providing an empirical basis from which to theorize the politics of adaptation. The final section concludes by describing the need for a reframing of adaptation policy, practice and analysis to engage with multiple adaptation knowledges, to question subjectivities inherent in discourses and problem understandings, and to identify how emancipatory subjectivities ‚Äì and thus the potential for transformational adaptation ‚Äì can be supported.},

This review examines theoretical and empirical literature from sustainability science, public administration, and science and technology studies (STS) with the intention of advancing the theory and practice of co-production within sustainability science. We argue that co-production must go beyond stakeholder engagement by scientists to the more deliberate design of societal transitions. Co-production can contribute to such transitions by shifting the institutional arrangements that govern relationships between knowledge and power, science and society, and state and citizens. We highlight critical weaknesses in conceptualizations of co-production within sustainability sciences with respect to power, politics, and governance. We offer suggestions for how this can be rectified through deeper engagement with public administration and STS to offer a broad vision for enhancing the use, design, and practice of a more reflexive co-production in sustainability science.

The first focuses at system performance, the second at system capacity to cope with change. The two schools of thought promote their own legitimacy, but undertake little effort to transcend their own perspective. Though, different scholars have pointed at the necessity of combining control and resilience for managing a system. We review the literature on control and resilience, synthesize the work in these fields into one coherent conceptual framework and reflect on the question whether control and resilience strategies can be reconciled or whether inevitable trade-offs are to be made. Based on a literature review, we develop a framework contrasting both rationales through their preferred (contrary) system attributes. Next, we discuss the operationalization of these system properties for policy development. Policies will generally reflect elements of both control and resilience. There will be trade-offs between preferred system attributes, where development of resilience restricts the development of possible control (and vice versa). The conceptual framework introduced provides a ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô for contrasting and possibly (partly) reconciling the control and resilience rationales. Such a language is crucial for a meaningful policy discourse between actors, because it helps in understanding the implications of different rationales and in comparing alternative policies in terms of control and resilience.},

The dominant research tradition on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an actor-centered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional learning.},

This challenge can be viewed as a problem in which human society must navigate in a limited space of acceptable futures in which humans enjoy sufficient well-being and avoid crossing planetary boundaries. A critical obstacle is the nature of society as a controller with endogenous dynamics affected by knowledge, values, and decision-making fallacies. We outline an approach for analyzing the role of knowledge infrastructure in maintaining safe operating spaces. Using a classic natural resource problem as an illustration, we find that a small safe operating space exists that is insensitive to the type of policy implementation, while in general, a larger safe operating space exists which is dependent on the implementation of the ‚Äúright‚Äù policy. Our analysis suggests the importance of considering societal response dynamics to varying policy instruments in defining the shape of safe operating spaces.},

	abstract = {Variable flows of food, water, or other ecosystem services complicate planning. Management strategies that decrease variability and increase predictability may therefore be preferred. However, actions to decrease variance over short timescales (2‚Äì4 y), when applied continuously, may lead to long-term ecosystem changes with adverse consequences. We investigated the effects of managing short-term variance in three well-understood models of ecosystem services: lake eutrophication, harvest of a wild population, and yield of domestic herbivores on a rangeland. In all cases, actions to decrease variance can increase the risk of crossing critical ecosystem thresholds, resulting in less desirable ecosystem states. Managing to decrease short-term variance creates ecosystem fragility by changing the boundaries of safe operating spaces, suppressing information needed for adaptive management, cancelling signals of declining resilience, and removing pressures that may build tolerance of stress. Thus, the management of variance interacts strongly and inseparably with the management of resilience. By allowing for variation, learning, and flexibility while observing change, managers can detect opportunities and problems as they develop while sustaining the capacity to deal with them.},

	abstract = {Developing effective governance structures for the fair and sustainable use of benefits that flow from shared natural resources is arguably one of the defining challenges of our time. Addressing this challenge has been extremely difficult because the associated governance problem is multifaceted and multilayered. Governance structures must address at least three interrelated issues: ( i ) equitable distribution within and across generations of affordances for well-being; ( ii ) social dilemmas associated with providing shared infrastructure and preventing overexploitation of shared resources; and ( iii ) coping with deep uncertainty and variability that complicates decision-making and planning efforts. Addressing these issues will often require us, both as individuals and in groups, to act against our natural tendencies. Familiar examples related to the first two issues include delaying rewards for the sake of future outcomes and overcoming our aversion to the ‚Äúsucker‚Äôs pay-off‚Äù to build sufficient trust to address social dilemmas. Recent work suggests that this is also true when coping with uncertainty and variability in benefit flows while sustaining them over the long term. Specifically, Carpenter et al. (1) develop an important set of ideas related to managing environmental variability that may cause two of our natural aversions to collide. The authors suggest that we must learn to live with a certain amount of variability if we want to enlarge the safe operating space for exploited ecosystems. Just as with delayed rewards, humans are averse to variability in benefit flows related to subsistence (2, 3). More challenging yet, because allowing variability in ecosystems may well involve reduced exploitation, we may be required to forego present consumption as well as tolerate variability to maintain a safe operating space for humanity.

Of these challenges, coping with uncertainty and variation in benefit flows is the most difficult to conceptualize. Although all three are difficult to address in practice, ‚Ä¶

Vulnerability is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and integration.},

In the past 20 years, complex adaptive systems have been sharpened from an abstract concept into a series of tools that can be used to solve concrete problems. These advances have been led by the development of new techniques for coupling ecological and evolutionary dynamics, for integrating dynamics across multiple scales of organization, and for using data to infer the complex interactions among different components of ecological systems. Focusing on the development and usage of these new methods, we discuss how they have led to an improved understanding of three universal features of complex adaptive systems, emergent patterns; tipping points and critical phenomena; and cooperative behavior. We restrict our attention primarily to marine ecosystems, which provide numerous successful examples of the application of complex adaptive systems. Many of these are currently undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic perturbations, and we take the opportunity to discuss how complex adaptive systems can be used to improve the management of public goods and to better preserve critical ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly between different regions and countries. It takes a critical stance on the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies‚Äô socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative ‚Äòglobal‚Äô regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor networks and institutional rationalities, which influence transition dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on globalization theories from sociology and human geography, we show that socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese wastewater sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on wastewater infrastructure expansion were not only influenced by path-dependencies stemming from China‚Äôs national context, but equally (or even more critically) by the dominant rationality of the water sector‚Äôs global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global socio-technical regimes.},

This paper argues that the transition to ‚Äòpost-fossil urbanization‚Äô is hampered by the lack of positive imaginations of alternative possible urban futures and post-fossil city life. It asks the question why it is so difficult to conceive of new possible urban worlds, and tries to answer it by using the established concept of ‚Äòimaginary‚Äô and introducing the concept of ‚Äòtechnique of futuring‚Äô. The salience of the imaginary of the modern city is used as an example. The paper points at the International Society for Organization (ISO) and ‚Äòliving labs‚Äô as contemporary techniques of futuring, organizing urban futures. It then aims to recoup one‚Äôs capacity to imagine alternative possible worlds and explores the role that academics can play in this endeavour.},

These trends elevate the frequency of ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù‚Äîconditions that are unexpected based on recent history. Here, we show that the frequency of surprising ocean temperatures has increased even faster than expected based on recent temperature trends. Using a simple model of human adaptation, we show that these surprises will increasingly challenge natural modes of adaptation that rely on historical experience. We also show that warming rates are likely to shift natural communities toward generalist species, reducing their productivity and diversity. Our work demonstrates increasing benefits for individuals and institutions from betting that trends will continue, but this strategy represents a radical shift that will be difficult for many to make.},

Sustainability concerns along the environmental and financial dimensions have motivated focus on waste and emissions reduction, new technology development, and greening of industrial ecosystems. The concept of inclusive development, however, has not yet permeated the research or conceptualization of sociotechnical systems. Two streams of on-going work in inclusive innovation and in inclusive wealth analysis offer meaningful avenues for future connections. We discuss how the literature on sociotechnical systems and their constituent elements of engineered products and processes has evolved on the topic of sustainability, how the emerging concept of inclusive innovation bridges dimensions of environment and social inclusivity, and how inclusive wealth may inform system-level planning and analysis of sociotechnical systems moving forward.},

It argues that international organizations have played a central role as entrepreneurs of such governance innovation in coalition with pro-active states and non-state actors, yet this entrepreneurship is risky and success is not assured.

Bridging this divide only adds to the already daunting challenge of securing climate stabilization. In fact, efforts towards the former are more likely to conflict with the latter. To be able to address this dilemma, the relationship between energy consumption and human well-being, beyond its economic dimension, needs to be better understood. This paper aims to contribute to the emerging knowledge base, by examining this relationship using a proxy for human well-being that also considers its environmental and social dimensions. The ultimate goal of this paper is to investigate the potential incompatibility between efforts towards the achievement of higher collective well-being and those associated with climate stabilization. To this end, it provides estimates of the additional energy needed and its associated carbon emissions under different climate scenarios, and compares them with existing carbon budgets. Results indicate that even if new climate policies were adopted, emissions associated with higher well-being in all regions where improvements are needed could still reach up to one and a half times estimated 2¬∞C budgets, and even more so for lower temperature increase targets.},

Experience shows the importance of clearly formulated questions, structured dialog, carefully designed scenarios, sophisticated biophysical and socioeconomic analysis, and iteration as needed to more effectively link the growing scenarios and foresight community with today's decision makers and to better address the social, economic, and environmental challenges of tomorrow.},

Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a high global priority.},

	abstract = {The term tipping point has experienced explosive popularity across multiple disciplines over the last decade. Research on social-ecological systems (SES) has contributed to the growth and diversity of the term‚Äôs use. The diverse uses of the term obscure potential differences between tipping behavior in natural and social systems, and issues of causality across natural and social system components in SES. This paper aims to create the foundation for a discussion within the SES research community about the appropriate use of the term tipping point, especially the relatively novel term ‚Äòsocial tipping point.‚Äô We review existing literature on tipping points and similar concepts (e.g. regime shifts, critical transitions) across all spheres of science published between 1960 and 2016 with a special focus on a recent and still small body of work on social tipping points. We combine quantitative and qualitative analyses in a bibliometric approach, rooted in an expert elicitation process. We find that the term tipping point became popular after the year 2000‚Äîlong after the terms regime shift and critical transition‚Äîacross all spheres of science. We identify 23 distinct features of tipping point definitions and their prevalence across disciplines, but find no clear taxonomy of discipline-specific definitions. Building on the most frequently used features, we propose definitions for tipping points in general and social tipping points in SES in particular.},

	abstract = {Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face of perturbations. Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

The field of transition studies has been critically interrogated for undermining the role of power, which has inspired various endeavours to theorize power and agency in transitions. This paper presents the POwer-IN-Transition framework (POINT), which is developed as a conceptual framework to analyse power and (dis)empowerment in transformative social change, integrating transition concepts and multiple power and empowerment theories. The first section introduces transitions studies and discusses its state-of-the-art regarding power. This is followed by a typology of power relations and different types of power (reinforcive, innovative, transformative). These notions are then used to reframe transition concepts, in particular the multi-level perspective, in terms of power dynamics. The critical challenges of (dis)empowerment and unintended power implications of discourses on and policies for sustainability transitions' are discussed. The paper concludes with a synthesis of the arguments and challenges for future research. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

-- The mobilize resources seems right and the shaping institutions seems right and both align with the three dimensions of power. Perhaps she misses the largest landscape level role of power in shaping goals, perceptions and beliefs.
-- emphasizes the different types of power dynamics and the degree to which each matters. Opens up space for empowerment when you have less of some types of power or overall less power, but you still have some. How do you use it effectivly. This is after all the main question.

-- Grin (2010) discusses agency in transitions in terms of "agents capacity' of "acting otherwise" and triggering institutional transofmrtaion by "smartly playing into power dynamics at various layers"
¬†
-- FOCUS "how actors engage with resources, structures and systems in different ways."¬† Opening up the space for more systematic understanding of empowerment.
-- actor specific power: "actor-specific resources used in the pursuit of self-interest (weber) or power as capacity of a social system to mobilize resoruces to realize collective goals (Parsons, 1963).

Different types of power: A and B exercise a different type of power to/over
Her table is not very nuanced about how exactly power is exercised, but rather looks at relational power between two actors and how differential power combined with different types of goals overlays to create a number of diverse posibilities for outcomes.
¬†
She has a list of resource types for power from Avelino and Rotmans 2011--they are pretty well aligned with our asset stocks:

Human capital: She calls this Human which she defines as "human leverage; personnel, members, voters
Natural capital: She calls this natural and defines as "raw materials, physical space, time, organic life (not sure that time makes a lot of sense but I otherwise agree"
Manufactured capital: She calls this Artifactual and defines this as "Apparatuses, products, construction, infrastructure, Art (music, painting, photography, dance".. also a bit off from our binning but not too bad.¬†
Knowledge capital: Which she calls Mental and defines as information, concepts, ideas and beliefs.
SHE DOES NOT HAVE A SOCIAL CAPITAL, but she does have Monetorary capital whcih includes funds, chas, financial stocks.


She maps all of these resources onto the types of power that is exercised. Which is very interesting, but I think it could be even better if the bins were better defined.

I draw from a case study on the transition towards electric automobility in the Netherlands. From the analysis, eight strategic rationales for taking part in niche activities are distilled. These go to show that it is not only a straightforward positive interest that motivates niche actors. However, the support from these actors is conditional and they are likely to end their support as soon as the emerging system no longer aligns with their interests.},

This builds on and develops previous coevolutionary analyses of long-term technological and industrial change, and recent renewed interest within ecological economics on coevolutionary approaches. Previous work has analysed how the coevolution of technologies and institutions has led to the lock-in of current high-carbon energy systems; and how the coevolution of physical and social technologies and business strategies has brought significant material and welfare benefits to the minority of the world's population living in industrialised countries. The coevolutionary framework proposed here may be used to undertake: (1) detailed empirical analyses at a micro‚Äìmeso level of the challenges relating to the innovation and adoption of particularly low-carbon technologies; (2) as a framework for analysing the multi-level interaction of social and technological elements within potential transition pathways to a low carbon energy system; (3) to assess the implications for economic growth and prosperity of a transition to a low carbon economy; and (4) to assist in the development of more formal, multi-level evolutionary economic models.},

The background is the very limited number of collaborations between scholars of social-ecological systems and sociotechnical systems (SES), despite repeated calls for bridging work. The synthesis builds on an in-depth review of previous literature, interdisciplinary exchanges, and empirical examples. The result is arguments for why a sociotechnical understanding of \&lsquo;technology\&rsquo; is of central importance for SES studies, related to how technology: (1) mediates human\&ndash;environment relationships; (2) brings ambivalence to these relationships; (3) enhances and transforms human agency and provides a source of constitutive power; (4) changes scalar relationships, enabling our interaction with and impact on the natural world across time and space. Furthermore, we present an STES analytical approach which starts from symmetrical attention to technology, society, and environment, specifically targeting interfaces and relationships of critical relevance for SES scholars, and address counterarguments that we have encountered. We conclude that a shift to STES research will enhance our knowledge of system interfaces that are often overlooked, opening further avenues for research and real-world interventions.},

	abstract = {Since the World War II, many economies have transitioned from an agrarian, biomass-based to an industrial, minerals-based metabolic regime. Since 1950, world population grew by factor 2.7 and global material consumption by factor 3.7‚Äì71Gigatonnes per year in 2010. The expansion of the resource base required by human societies is associated with growing pressure on the environment and infringement on the habitats of other species. In order to achieve a sustainability transition, we require a better understanding of the currently ongoing metabolic transition and its potential inertia. In this article, we present a long-term global material flow dataset covering material extraction, trade, and consumption of 177 individual countries between 1950 and 2010. We trace patterns and trends in material flows for six major geographic and economic country groupings and world regions (Western Industrial, the (Former) Soviet Union and its allies, Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa) as well as their contribution to the emergence of a global metabolic profile during a period of rapid industrialization and globalization. Global average material use increased from 5.0 to 10.3tons per capita and year (t/cap/a) between 1950 and 2010. Regional metabolic rates range from 4.5t/cap/a in Sub-Saharan Africa to 14.8t/cap/a in the Western Industrial grouping. While we can observe a stabilization of the industrial metabolic profile composed of relatively equal shares of biomass, fossil energy carriers, and construction minerals, we note differences in the degree to which other regions are gravitating toward a similar form of material use. Since 2000, Asia has overtaken the Western Industrial grouping in terms of its share in global resource use although not in terms of its per capita material consumption. We find that at a sub-global level, the roles of the world regions have changed. There are, however, no signs yet that this will lead to stabilization or even a reduction of global resource use.},

(entrenched power in science, technology and innovation )
¬†




Hi Bill;
¬†
I read through the Stirling paper "How deep is incumbency?‚Äù With ¬†a fine-tooth comb which took a while because its very dense. Here is my review which is also in Zotero. While its very dense, its well worth the effort as Stirling addresses many of the ‚Äúwhat is the system‚Äù questions we have been struggling with and it may serve us well to adopt some of his language.¬†











BC: I started my comments on your comments below with your purple questions.¬† ¬†Maybe read those first, then come back up here for my secondary comments on your numbered points.¬† Also note that I have highlighted what seemed important to me with yellow in the text.











¬†
1. Stirling wants to expand the notion of incumbency from discipline specific like socio-technical incumbency to include any ‚Äúdomain of what might potentially be self to be salient to change in any given feature of the world, extends in principle to the totality of what exists or is variously imaginable around the world.‚Äù In other words, he is developing an approach that is balanced across multiple dimensions and perspectives on power and incumbency. ‚ÄúWithout unduly redirecting scope for important nuances, disparities and context-specificities in particular settings [action situations].‚Äù ¬†











BC: He has some great ideas that have me thinking where I wasn't.¬† But he also writes as though he lived permanently in the Great London Fog.
BC: His ambitions to be balanced notwithstanding, he pretty much ignores nature (see below).











¬†
2. Because he wants to be as general as possible he uses the language¬†‚Äúsocial-material pathways‚Äù.¬†Is the the language we should adopt? Does "social-material‚Äù capture all the flows of resource stocks? I think it does but please comment.¬†











BC: See my comments on your questions below.











¬†
3. His introduction is useful in that it highlights the many global challenges related to incumbency: ‚ÄúIt is increasingly recognized that the depths and extents of particular kinds of incumbency often form a reason why so many grave worldwide problems remain so persistently unresolved ‚Äî including inequality, oppression, climate disruption, ecological destruction, toxic pollution and nuclear risks, as well as perennial obscenity and waste of ward. Finding ways to balance incumbent interests on such issues present some of the most pressing political priorities in the contemporary world‚Äù.¬†











BC: Yes, I agree that this is great.¬† ¬†Just see below on my comments that not all stickyness or path dependence is due to power.











¬†
4. To understand incumbency he argues need tools to understand agency and the "capacity for action‚Äù. Stirling goes through a lot of dense theoretical discussion not all of which I found at helpful about how to think about agency but ultimately settles on¬†structuration¬†theory‚Äîits neither structure nor agency but both and a struggle between the two (our "yes and" argument).¬†











BC:¬† Agree.¬† ¬†You explained it better to me than he did.¬† ¬†But I agree that we were already where he wants to take us with your "yes and."¬† Thanks.











¬†
5. He has a figure that is very interesting as it maps different kinds of ‚Äúsocio-material positive-feedback dynamics‚Äù on axis that include¬†whether the positive feedback dynamics are oriented more to structure or agency¬†(e.g. ¬†homeostasis vs entrapment) and whether the dynamics are more mechanistic or emergent (e.g. entrenchment vs technological-drift). Finally, he discussed the ways the dynamics are mainly apprehended from interpretive constructivist, to positive analytic to quantitative aggregative (see for example imaginaries as example of constructivist, path dependency as example of positive analytic and economics of scale as quantitative aggregative). SEE FIGURE ATTACHED. What is cool about the figure as it brings together different language to describe socio-material incumbency across a wide range of literatures that treat the phenomenon slightly differently. Structure people probably see incumbency as free from agency, but the figure reminds us that maintaining structure requires its own kind of agency in acts of ‚Äústatus due bias‚Äù and ‚Äúroutines‚Äù.¬†











BC:¬† I can imagine that this may help us get our thoughts in order.¬† ¬†But in my mind it is precisely the sort of "inside baseball" figure that we do NOT want to reproduce in a review that is supposed to speak to engineers and ecologists as well as social studies scholars.¬† ¬†Am I missing something?











¬†
6.¬†‚ÄúSocio-Material¬†incumbency is¬†fundamentally about power.‚Äù¬†Stirling¬†argues that all of the various definitions of ‚Äúsocio-material positive feedback‚Äù have one thing in common which is¬†power¬†which he defines as ‚Äúdifferent forms and conditions of ‚Äòasymmetrically structuring agency‚Äô‚Äù. By¬†asymmetric¬†he means the power to¬†create structures that "orient some onward course of events [development pathways] rather than others.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†This definition is confusing, but what he means by it is the power to organize the¬†rules of the system I believe within a ‚Äôsocio-material‚Äô development pathway. I think all three dimensions of power that we usually talk about can collapse within the definition of ‚Äúasymmetrically structuring agency‚Äù but I am not sure its usually useful to do this except to make the point that all three dimensions of power serve to reenforce socio-material incumbency (which is a useful point).¬†
¬†
7. The paper discusses two attributes of gradients of power including intensity and directionality. ‚ÄúFirst, there are the ‚Äôscalar intensities‚Äô of power associated with any given candidate instance of incumbency. Second, there is the ‚Äòvector directionality‚Äô of associated orientations for change at any particular locus of interest.‚Äù I believe that both the issues of intensity and directionality help us (BS and AGH) think about using power gradients within development pathways of socio-material incumbency and modeling this as a CAS. The intensity and directionality would I believe imply something about the slop of the attractor domains that should be captured in our figure.¬†











BC (not, I hope, BS as you have labeled me above): I like the two dimensions of power / incumbency.¬† ¬†I am not sure about translating this into a practical notion of "power gradients" or about slopes... though slopes I can maybe imagine.











¬†
8. Use of the word focal. Here, the current socio-material pathway is referred to as the ‚Äúfocal socio-material pathway‚Äù. I have a few times brought up the possibility of replacing action situation with focal situation. Striling's use of focal pathway suggests that I am not alone in this preference. Thoughts? ¬†Note that Geels ( 2011) also uses focal:¬†"Positive and negative influences from other regimes on the focal regime are an understudied but promising topic."
** In Zotero you will find this paper highly marked up.¬†











BC:¬† See below.¬† ¬†I get virtually no hits to "focal" paired with anything relevant.¬† ¬†Why would we replace a term that is well know and used in the field with one that is not?











¬†
¬†
9. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the entire thrust of the paper is an argument against the reification of middle range theories like socio-technical regimes and regime incumbency. Stirling feels that the reification of social science theories lead to a tendency to engage in ‚Äúeagle eye views‚Äù and cockpit-ism in policy solutions. He argues that ‚Äúdespite the wealth of evidence and experience qualifying romanticized aspirations to control the inconvenient fact that ‚Äôthere is no cockpit‚Äô in global governance remains effectively ignored." He feels that rather than an eagle-eyed perspective, we should have a worm-eyed perspective on socio-material regime incumbency where many factors are holding complex and overlapping regime type structures in place views of individual overly determined regime ‚Äúdevelopment pathways‚Äù oversimply things. He would almost certainly say this about our \#\#SustSci framework. I don‚Äôt think this means we should not use it, but with due acknowledgement that while it is a birds eye view, the real world is clearly more complex. The usefulness of the framework is to help various disparate parts of the field communicate and not as a complete model for how the world works.¬†










BC:¬† I found the regime discussion to be very useful.¬† ¬†I think, however, that his effort to connect his very insightful remarks about regimes to his long standing rant against "top down" and "cockpits" does not entirely work.¬† So lets try to distinguish the strong argument he makes from the rest.¬† ¬†Here are some points of departure from my side:¬†¬†













I see his helpful perspective on regimes to be something of a mix between STS perspectives (they are socially constructed) and Scott perspectives (top down prescription not only doesn't work, it reinforces power asymmetries)¬†
His rant on top down and cockpits is fair enough, the SDGs notwithstanding, and seems to me fully in line with Scott.¬† ¬†So is his argument that the pursuit of sustainability is ultimately a political affair.¬† ¬†We should be sure we are saying this emphatically up front.¬† ¬†I think I would even be prepared to introduce his views of incumbency as the ulitimate barrier to sustainability¬† in our Intro.
One of the other "strong" things I want to take from his paper is his observation that the power distributions of incumbency often run across multiple regimes (or whatever you call them).¬† ¬† This seems to me to be of fundamental importance.¬† ¬†I elaborate in my response to your questions below.
He is not quite consistent in his treatment of regimes.¬† For instance, at one point he defines them (citing reference 458) as "the dominant way that a societal function is fulfilled."¬† ¬†That is a view I could live with for "energy regimes" "food regimes" etc.¬† ¬† It is also consistent with the description I cite in the draft review of something like "characteristic behaviors" of the variables involved in fullfilling a societal function.¬† ¬†His real objection, which he reiterates, is with reference to "THE regime" (as though it were an autonomous thing, like a carbon atom) rather than a construction driven by our choice of which "societal function" to be interested in, our assessment of "the dominant way" power and other relationships are "structurated" (ugh!) to fulfill that function, etc.¬† ¬†I think that with due deference to STS and Scott we should be able to rescue "regimes" in a useful way for the review that he might even find acceptable.













¬†
My main questions for you are:


Should we adopt the term ‚Äúsocio-material incumbency‚Äù and "socio-material development pathway??¬†

BC:¬† I like the term "incumbancy" and gather it has some standing in social science.¬† ¬†I think it could well complement our discussions of power and transitions.¬† ¬†The one thing we should be more careful than the author on is that not all forces keeping systems in their "regimes" (see below) or pathways are related to power.¬† ¬†Some really are entirely from the natural system (think interglacial climate regimes).¬† ¬†That said, as I seem to recall us arguing in ESPP11, even path dependence or regimes or segregation patterns that have "natural" roots get reenforced by human power and incumbancies.
BC:¬† I also like how he sums up his view of power (see below).
BC:¬† On "socio-material X" my view is that we should not adopt this term except perhaps in a footnote.¬† ¬† A couple of reasons.¬† ¬†

Throughout our drafts, we have been trying to reduce the use of jargon, use terms people are familiar with, and focus on big picture issues rather than the nuances of debates on the differences between closely related concepts (e.g. robustness and resilience).¬† ¬†This goes in the wrong direction (neither term gets any hits at the topic level in WoS).¬† ¬†¬†
We are aiming in this review at emphasizing that sustainability must be based on an understanding of the the intertwined character of environment and development, nature and society, etc.¬† ¬†"Socio-material" is only marginally less narrow than the "socio-technical" I have ranted about before.¬† In both cases, tech is given special consideration as a part of society, and nature is ignored.¬† ¬†Even if one allows that the convoluted argument about "material" could include carbon flows or mercury flows, its hard to imagine any natural scientist believing that it captures "scrublands", and it literally excludes energy.¬† ¬† I believe that our current default for this modifier is "nature-society," which I don't love but which does the job of capturing environment and human development.¬† ¬† Our review of the lit shows the most frequently used (but misleading) term is "socio-ecological."¬† ¬†I do not see how "socio-material" is an improvement.


BC:¬† On "pathway" I think we are well served by "development" pathway.¬† ¬†Though maybe that is too social-centric, as is "socio-material development pathway.¬† ¬†Maybe we should be talking about something more balanced, like "pathway of nature-society coevolution" or "Anthropocene pathway."¬† ¬†But for the reasons noted above, I don't see his usage as an inclusive improvement for us.


This whole discussion as incumbency as structured by ‚Äúasymmetrically structuring power‚Äù I think has to do with the gradients of the development pathways we have been thinking about drawing. It would be useful I think to think about this together a bit more and figure out exactly what we want in our figure of three potential attractor domains/regimes. What are the gradients with respect to incumbency, the power that creates the positive feedbacks of incumbency power and separately how do we layer inclusive wealth on all of this.¬†

BC: His usage is "power as asymmetrically structuring agency" (i.e. structuring agency, not "structuring power").¬† ¬†I like the idea, as I like his notion of "democracy" as "access by the least powerful to the capacities for challenging power" (pg. 16).¬† ¬†I think we should work with these, especially in (y)our treatment of a) structure/agency; b) power; c) capacity/capability.
BC: I also like "incumbency" as about authority and "more general concentrations of influence, privilege and power," and "a reason why so many grave worldwide problems remain so persistently unresolved.... Finding ways to to balance the effects of incumbent interests on such issues present some of the most pressing political priorities in the contemporary world."¬† If we skip over "socio-material" for the moment (see above), and imagine that we could reduce the density of jargon, I also like "a general definition for the central concept of socio-material incumbency as: a multiplexity of dynamics through which a particular pathway in interacting [everything] phenomena is reproduced by -- and reinforcing of -- associated power gradients."
BC:¬† I guess I don't understand your reference to "gradients of development pathways...."¬† ¬†
BC: On inclusive wealth, etc.¬† ¬†I guess I imagine that a past or forecast or scenario development pathway can be scored for sustainability in multiple ways.¬† ¬†We seem to be suggesting with our "necessary conditions...." to score each on¬†

IW (including access and weighting to reflect our equity concerns),¬†
adaptive capacity
capacity for sustainability transition... which I assume must include something about the capacity to break incumbancies (??)
We have skated around the Sen argument about empowerment/capacity/capability.¬† ¬† Perhaps those concerns fold into the 3 criteria above.¬† ¬†Perhaps we add a 4th about capability/power?¬† ¬†I think that would be consistent with this article.




Should we use focal instead of action¬†situation.¬†

BC: In my view, no.¬† It is introducing new, barely used terminology (It has 3 instances over the last 10 years in topic searches in WoS, whereas Action situation has 46) for no clear advantage.¬† ¬†And it will be confusing if we keep using "focal scale" (which I realize he thinks is part of the problem).¬† ¬† ¬†My own not well articulated view is that we want to embrace his notion that dominant power gradients cut across particular regimes (or whatever he calls them), e.g. its the same US hegemony that reshapes trade treaties and climate treaties and defense treaties.... and the same concentrated wealth that shapes the energy regime and food regimes and so on.¬† ¬†And that that we need to separate our analysis of cross cutting power from our analysis of particular problems or regimes.



¬†
Overall the figures in the paper may be worth¬†thinking through together as its really a tour de force.¬† ¬† ¬†BC: Happy to talk and the rest through.¬† ¬†Say when....
¬†
¬†

Thanks,
Alicia¬†

	abstract = {Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven. Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime shifts and {\textgreater} 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.},

Moreover, accurate substitutability estimates are even more difficult to produce for unpriced or mispriced resources. Finally, we provide evidence from industrial energy use, and agricultural land use, that suggests substitutability of natural capital with other forms of capital may be low to moderate.},

We take stock of this budding research area to further show the strength of SEN analysis for complex human-environment settings, identify future synergies between SEN and wider human-environment research, and provide guidance about when to use different kinds of SEN approaches and models. We characterize SEN research along a spectrum specifying the degree of explicit network representation of system components and dynamics. We then systematically review one end of this spectrum, what we term ‚Äòfully articulated SEN‚Äô studies, which specifically model unique social and ecological units and relationships. Results show a larger number of papers focus on methodological advancement and applied ends. While there has been some development and testing of theories, this remains an area for future work and would help develop SENs as a unique field of research, not just a method. Authors have studied diverse systems, while mainly focusing on the problem of social-ecological fit alongside a scattering of other topics. There is strong potential, however, to engage other issues central to human-environment studies. Analyzing the simultaneous effects of multiple social, environmental, and coupled processes, change over time, and linking network structures to outcomes are also areas for future advancement. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN research, a necessary step that can help scholars develop comparable cases and fill research gaps.},

Such cross-scale social relations can be analysed through a telecoupling framework as decisions taken at local scales are often shaped by actors at larger scales. Analyzing these cross-scale relations is critical to create effective and equitable strategies to manage ecosystem services. Here, we develop an analytical framework ‚Äìi.e. the ‚Äòcross-scale influence-dependence framework‚Äô- to facilitate the analysis of power asymmetries and the distribution of ecosystem services among the beneficiaries. We illustrate the suitability of this framework through its retrospective application across four case studies, in which we characterize the level of dependence of multiple actors on a particular set of ecosystem services, and their influence on decision-making regarding these services across three spatial scales. The ‚Äòcross-scale influence-dependence framework‚Äô can improve our understanding of distributional and procedural equity and thus support the development of policies for sustainable management of ecosystem services.},

Capitalism is on the verge of destroying the planet and destabilizing society as wealth rushes to the top. The time for action is running short. Rebecca Henderson's rigorous research in economics, psychology, and organizational behavior, as well as her many years of work with companies around the world, gives us a path forward. She debunks the worldview that the only purpose of business is to make money and maximize shareholder value. She shows that we have failed to reimagine capitalism so that it is not only an engine of prosperity but also a system that is in harmony with environmental realities, striving for social justice and the demands of truly democratic institutions. Henderson's deep understanding of how change takes place, combined with fascinating in-depth stories of companies that have made the first steps towards reimagining capitalism, provides inspiring insight into what capitalism can be. With rich discussions of how the worlds of finance, governance, and leadership must also evolve, Henderson provides the pragmatic foundation for navigating a world faced with unprecedented challenge, but also with extraordinary opportunity for those who can get it right"--},

The results provide an in-depth assessment of the status of the literature on learning in the context of environmental policy, as well as the quality of the literature. We demonstrate that despite the diversity in research questions and goals, the literature is lacking with respect to diversity in cases and context, theoretical development, clear conceptualization and operationalization of learning, and advancements in empirical approaches to study learning.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Griggs et al. (2013) redefine sustainable development as ‚Äúdevelopment that meets the needs of the present while
safeguarding Earth‚Äôs life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depend.‚Äù We recommend this as the
end goal that the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) should strive to achieve. Integration across the SDGs is less
than what is required from a science perspective. Effective implementation of the SDGs will require States to attend to trade-offs and
overlaps. We argue that continuous failure to address integration within the SDGs will jeopardize realization of this ultimate end goal.
Therefore, we adopt a systems approach to identify gaps and connections across the goals and targets of the SDGs as well as leverage
points for effective intervention. We triangulate across methods of critical analysis, conceptual modeling, and keyword network analysis
to draw out seven ‚Äúoverarching directions‚Äù that could provide a prioritization framework to enhance efficient implementation of the
SDGs. Our results identify main gaps as exclusion of key actors (e.g., corporations) and issues (e.g., intergenerational equity and
population); inadequate reconciliation of economic growth with maintaining the Earth system; and deficient consideration of the
relationship with international law. Conceptual mapping identifies education and innovation; governance and implementation;
sustainable consumption and production; and addressing the key drivers of climate change as key leverage points. The keyword analysis
highlights greater integration within the SDGs than what appears at face value. Keywords ‚Äúaccess,‚Äù ‚Äúwomen,‚Äù ‚Äúresources,‚Äù and ‚Äúfinance‚Äù
feature across the SDGs and provide further leverage points. Targeting these issues will facilitate realization of a high proportion of
SDGs and correspondingly could have a disproportional impact on effective SDG implementation. We conclude that the success of
the SDGs needs to be evaluated by the extent to which it contributes to human development while advancing protection of ‚Äúplanetary
must-haves‚Äù for current and future generations.},

	abstract = {This book uncovers how power operates around the world, and how it can be resisted or transformed through empowered collective action and social leadership. The stakes have never been higher. Recent years have seen a rapid escalation of inequalities, the rise of new global powers and corporate interests, increasing impunity of human rights violations, suppression of civil society, and a re-shaping of democratic processes by post-truth, populist and nationalist politics.

Rather than looking at power through the lenses of agency or structure alone, this book views power and empowerment as complex and multidimensional societal processes, defined by pervasive social norms, conditions, constraints and opportunities. Bridging theory and practice, the book explores real-world applications using a selection of frameworks, tools, case studies, examples, resources and reflections from experience to support actors to analyse their positioning and align themselves with progressive social forces.

Compiled with social change practitioners, students and scholars in mind, Power, Empowerment and Social Change is the perfect volume for anyone involved in politics, international development, sociology, human rights and environmental justice who is looking for fresh insights for transforming power in favour of relatively less powerful people.},

The Scheve and Stasavage piece on inequality and democracy is a useful citation for the equity section because we can use it to say that we still don‚Äôt have a lot of empirical evidence that links inequality and participation, nor participation and sustainability in the aggregate. That said, the whole piece shows that the three causal reasons why democracy is not always linked to lower inequality is POWER. They dont come out and say this explicitly, but all three mechanisms they describe for why democracy does not empirically lead to lower inequality are power arguments. So I think the citation is useful for two reasons. The first is that we still don‚Äôt have very clean empirical patterns about relationship between inequality and empowerment (e.g. through democracy) but we also know that power matters in that its what is causing the story to be complex rather than the predicted ‚Äúdemocracy should lead to people voting for inequality reducing policies". This combined with data on the capture of the state by fossil fuel interests is all the evidence I think we need to say that we need to study empowerment both for our ‚Äúends‚Äù argument around equity as part of all sustainability goals, but also because despite the complexity of the relationship between inequality, democracy and other sustainability outcomes (e.g. environmental degradation often associated with poverty, but sometimes also collective action and CPR management overcomes this), its hard to imagine actually constraining the behavior of powerful bad actors who want to plunder resources for their own benefit at the expense of vulnerable population today and future generations without finding ways to constrain their power or empower other actors relative to them. The goal is perhaps to have rights for these groups, but these rights have to be fought for and defended. Thus, empowerment is still a key capacity for SD even if the link between empowerment and SD outcomes are very complex.¬†
-----------------
Abstract: What do we know about wealth inequality and democracy? Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evi- dence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter pref- erences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the ev- idence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research. 
1. We assume democratic societies should be more equal because people should vote for this, but empirically it is not always the case. 
"If one were asked to sum up the received wisdom about these questions, it would be that wealth inequality is bad for democracy, and yet democracies are also likely to implement policies that reduce wealth inequality. The simple reason for this is that those with no or little wealth are more numerous and therefore have more votes than the wealthy."




"There is little evidence of an automatic link between democracy and wealth inequality. Democracy has many virtues, but it does not necessarily put societies on a path to greater wealth equality. This is not because public policy does not make a difference but rather because democracies do not necessarily implement wealth-equalizing policies." 
They give many reasons. Latent in all of them is power. But its amazing that they dont often explicitly mention this. I have assigned my own view of what dimensions of power each of their explanations is talking about. Need for causal identification seems to make them quite circumspect about talking about power. This is both a good and a bad thing--we should be humble in our claims, but perhaps still make them..... See the agrument of Rodrik about policies to reembed inequality in his recent blog post.




2.¬† Why?

When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth --{\textgreater} fight about other things and vote on those things. E.g. Abortion. So work to create these cleavages if you want to mainatine inequality. 3rd dimension.
Change peoples beliefs about the fairness of redistribution. So perhaps that they will also be impacted or their future selves might be impacted. Or it will slow economic growth because everyone up by their bootstraps. 3rd dimension
Capture the democratic process. 2nd dimension

¬†
DETAILS
1. Snowballing properties of wealth inequality. CItations to Benhabib \& Bisin 2016.¬†
2. Wealth inequality tends to evolve slowly over time. Therefore if we want to understand its determinants, we should consider long-run evidence.
3. Seems not a clear link between levels of inequality and long term outcomes in terms of type of political regime chosen. But the whole debate is contested by scholars. Key message is that there is minimal evidence for a link between inequality and democracy.
4. Nicely for my own work, they argue that land in most socities is a good proxie for inequality. They note that. "With the caveat that land inequality is extremely persistent over time (the correlation between land inequality circa 1950 and land inequality circa 1990 is 0.90), estimation of a difference-in-differences specification suggested no correlation whatsoever between land inequality and democracy."
5. Manipulating fairness priors: "




 Piketty (1995) examined how individuals can draw from their personal and family experience to infer (potentially with error) whether income is acquired as a result of luck or effort, and he suggested that this would guidevoterpreferences.Be ÃÅnabou\&Tirole(2006)extendedthistoasettingwhereindividualscan manipulate their own beliefs (or those of their children) to maintain effort. Important earlier work in political science by Lane (1959) and Hochschild (1986) considered how individuals form beliefs about whether the distribution of resources in society is fair and how these beliefs influence their policy preferences." 
6. Evidence for importance of norms: "In our study Taxing the Rich (Scheve \& Stasavage 2016), we demonstrated how citizens‚Äô fairness perceptions influence a government‚Äôs decisions on how heavily to tax its wealthiest citizens. As a result of that influence, fairness perceptions, and in particular changing fairness perceptions, have influenced the distribution of wealth." 
7. They cite Lindblom's market as prison piece. Which means they are clearly smart. ;-)




"A second approach to captured democracy is to suggest not that wealth inequality in general generates capture, but instead that wealth inequality in the context of a market economy generates capture. This is the phenomenon that Lindblom (1982) referred to as ‚Äúthe market as prison.‚Äù Likewise, Przeworski \& Wallerstein (1988) suggest how the state can be ‚Äústructurally dependent‚Äù on owners of capital because without their investments the economy will not flourish." 
8. Useful for ARER power argument: behavior of legislatures goes along with high income Constituents. Easier to measure in US state legislators dont always vote with party and where votes are transparent recorded.




"A third approach to investigating captured democracy is to measure the extent to which the behavior of legislators is most highly correlated with that of their high-income constituents. Using this approach, Bartels (2008) provided initial evidence for a bias of this sort. Gilens (2012) then provided more extensive evidence that pointed in exactly the same direction. This approach provides a useful way of thinking about captured democracy." 
¬†
9. Capture through resources: Easier to measure in US where lobbying is legal but transparent. Harder elsewhere.¬†




"A fourth approach is to consider explicitly how those with wealth are able to use their resources to capture policy making. This has been considered in a general theoretical setting by Acemoglu \& Robinson (2008)."

My Take Overall: I did not find this paper very interesting. Its like political science suddenly realized that future generations exist and decided to review the literature and arguments that SustSci and philosophy have been aware of for a while. They go through a lot of nuance, but nothing really helps us think about HOW to include future generations, they are rather thinking about whether their is a future generation obligation and if so what it looks like-- e.g. is it ok to leave debt to future generations.
That said, it reviews a lot of the literature on goals from philosophy, so if we are trying to cite recent Annual Review papers, than we can cite it. Its just not that well done.
The most interesting parts to me looked at the question of political responsibilities to the future.
"By this, I mean the responsibilities that focus on political institutions and ask what respecting future generations requires in terms of either (a) creating new political institutions and reforming existing ones or (b) respecting future political institutions. One approach is essentially instrumental and is centered on a. It starts by reflecting on what economic and ecological responsibilities one generation has to future generations, and it then argues that current generations should design political institutions so that (consistent with other moral values) they best realize these principles of intergenerational justice. The political responsibilities to the future are thus defined in terms of responsibilities to create and maintain institutions that further intergenerational distributive justice (Caney 2016). A related instrumental approach argues that current generations have political responsibilities to protect the functioning of democratic institutions in the future (Thompson 2010)."
This to me is an argument that should be back up in sustained under social capital. --{\textgreater} so goes with our own argument nicely, but from the political science view.¬† The question of course for governance and empowerment is how to do this....

Key Points

Discussion of whether or not future generations includes those who are not yet citizens... cant vote. Different organizations who advocate for future generations treat this differently. 
Discussion of distant future vs our kids... no conclusion just point not very systematically to some points of the debate. 
Geographical scope: do we care about all future, or just those in our country? 
The most interesting part is around a close read of Rawls perspective on future generations (see quotes below). Rawls early work did not think very cogently about this. In particular the issue of declining natural capital and potential tipping points. Perhaps the issues of intergenerational sustainability are unique to the Anthropocene that Rawls was a bit before (my own thoughts). 
That said, by end of career, had a view of intergenerational justice that very much supports the sustained argument. 

"agree to a savings principle subject to the further condition that they must want all previous generations to have followed it. Thus the correct principle is that which the members of any generation (and so all generations) would adopt as the one their generation is to follow and as the principle they would want preceding generations to have followed (and later generations to follow), no matter how far back (or forward) in time. (Rawls 1993, p. 274; see also Rawls 1971, p. 289) "


Discussion of fair shares of what.... 

resources (Barry 1991)
capabilities to function (Sen 2009 and Nussbaum 2011)



Other interesting points:
Some interesting notes on Rawls:

"Given the influence of Rawls‚Äôs theory of distributive justice, it is natural to start by considering how his theory treats future generations. His account of justice to future generations in A Theory of Justice (Rawls 1971) has four core elements. The first concerns the membership of the contract. Rawls argues that the parties to the ‚Äúoriginal position‚Äù are the members of a single generation (Rawls 1971, pp. 140, 292), and he rejects proposals that the original position should include all who will exist or who could exist (Rawls 1971, p. 139). The second feature concerns the motivations of the parties. Rawls here departs from his general assumption that the parties are ‚Äúmutually disin- terested,‚Äù writing that the parties (who, recall, are ‚Äúheads of families‚Äù) care about their immediate descendants. As he puts it, ‚Äútheir goodwill stretches over at least two generations‚Äù (Rawls 1971, p. 128). The third feature of his approach is his assumption that principles of distributive justice (such as the Difference Principle) hold only among schemes of reciprocity. He further holds that different generations are not engaged in a scheme of reciprocity with each other and so concludes that the Difference Principle does not apply across time (Rawls 1971, p. 291)."
"His assumption here takes us back to A8. The Rawlsian approach maintains that we cannot simply apply the same prin- ciple to future generations that we would apply to contemporaries, for, on his account, there is a morally significant difference. Reciprocity exists among contemporaries but not between one gen- eration and subsequent nonoverlapping ones. We know then what the parties would not choose. But what would they choose? Rawls‚Äôs answer‚Äîthe fourth feature of his approach‚Äîis that the par- ties would select a ‚Äújust savings principle‚Äù (Rawls 1971, pp. 284‚Äì93). This, interestingly, is focused on passing on just institutions to future generations, and it is not concerned with wealth except insofar as that is needed to create and support just institutions."






"agree to a savings principle subject to the further condition that they must want all previous generations to have followed it. Thus the correct principle is that which the members of any generation (and so all generations) would adopt as the one their generation is to follow and as the principle they would want preceding generations to have followed (and later generations to follow), no matter how far back (or forward) in time. (Rawls 1993, p. 274; see also Rawls 1971, p. 289)"

We describe how different scientific approaches and methodological positions explore diverse types of transitions and provide the basis for multiple theories and models for governance of sustainability transitions. We distinguish three perspectives in studying transitions: socio-technical, socio-institutional, and socio-ecological. Although the field as a whole is very heterogeneous, commonalities can be characterized in notions such as path dependencies, regimes, niches, experiments, and governance. These more generic concepts have been adopted within the analytical perspective of transitions, which has led three different types of approaches to dealing with agency in transitions: analytical, evaluative, and experimental. The field has by now produced a broad theoretical and empirical basis along with a variety of social transformation strategies and instruments, impacting disciplinary scientific fields as well as (policy) practice. In this article, we try to characterize the field by identifying its main perspectives, approaches and shared concepts, and its relevance to real-world sustainability problems and solutions.},

The Great Leveler is the first book to chart the crucial role of violent shocks in reducing inequality over the full sweep of human history around the world. Ever since humans began to farm, herd livestock, and pass on their assets to future generations, economic inequality has been a defining feature of civilization. Over thousands of years, only violent events have significantly lessened inequality. The "Four Horsemen" of leveling--mass-mobilization warfare, transformative revolutions, state collapse, and catastrophic plagues--have repeatedly destroyed the fortunes of the rich. Scheidel identifies and examines these processes, from the crises of the earliest civilizations to the cataclysmic world wars and communist revolutions of the twentieth century. Today, the violence that reduced inequality in the past seems to have diminished, and that is a good thing. But it casts serious doubt on the prospects for a more equal future.

The aim of this special feature is to provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to caution against the tendency, when confronted with pervasive uncertainty, to believe that scholars can generate simple models of linked social‚Äìecological systems and deduce general solutions to the overuse of resources. Practitioners and scholars who fall into panacea traps falsely assume that all problems of resource governance can be represented by a small set of simple models, because they falsely perceive that the preferences and perceptions of most resource users are the same. Readers of this special feature will become acquainted with many cases in which panaceas fail. The articles provide an excellent overview of why they fail. Furthermore, the articles in this special feature address how scholars and public officials can increase the prospects for future sustainable resource use by facilitating a diagnostic approach in selecting appropriate starting points for governance and monitoring, as well as by learning from the outcomes of new policies and adapting in light of effective feedback.},

	abstract = {One of the most vexing human rights issues of our time has been how to protect the rights of individuals and communities worldwide in an age of globalization and multinational business. Indeed, from Indonesian sweatshops to oil-based violence in Nigeria, the challenges of regulating harmful corporate practices in some of the world s most difficult regions long seemed insurmountable. Human rights groups and businesses were locked in a stalemate, unable to find common ground. In 2005, the United Nations appointed John Gerard Ruggie to the modest task of clarifying the main issues. Six years later, he had accomplished much more than that. Ruggie had developed his now-famous "Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights," which provided a road map for ensuring responsible global corporate practices. The principles were unanimously endorsed by the UN and embraced and implemented by other international bodies, businesses, governments, workers organizations, and human rights groups, keying a revolution in corporate social responsibility. Just Business tells the powerful story of how these landmark Ruggie Rules came to exist. Ruggie demonstrates how, to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem, he had to abandon many widespread and long-held understandings about the relationships between businesses, governments, rights, and law, and develop fresh ways of viewing the issues. He also takes us through the journey of assembling the right type of team, of witnessing the severity of the problem firsthand, and of pressing through the many obstacles such a daunting endeavor faced. Just Business is an illuminating inside look at one of the most important human rights developments of recent times. It is also an invaluable book for anyone wanting to learn how to navigate the tricky processes of global problem-solving and consensus-building and how to tackle big issues with ambition, pragmatism, perseverance, and creativity."‚ÄìPublisher description.},

Each of these draws attention to different dimensions of social‚Äìecological systems, with their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the sustainability of social‚Äìecological systems. Therefore we present a typology which defines and summarizes the three major types of fit and can be used to organize and advance systematic theoretical and policy relevant inquiry.},

	abstract = {Modern energy systems have tended towards centralized control by states, and national and multinational energy companies. This implicates the power of elites in realizing low-carbon transitions. In particular, low-carbon transitions can create, perpetuate, challenge, or entrench the power of elites. Using a critical lens that draws from geography, political science, innovation studies, and social justice theory (among others), this article explores the ways in which transitions can exacerbate, reconfigure or be shaped by ‚Äúelite power.‚Äù It does so by offering a navigational approach that surveys a broad collection of diverse literatures on power. It begins by conceptualizing power across a range of academic disciplines, envisioning power as involving both agents (corrective influence) and structures (pervasive influence). It then elaborates different types of power and the interrelationship between different sources of power, with a specific focus on elites, including conceptualizing elite power, resisting elite power, and power frameworks. The Review then examines scholarship relevant to elite power in low-carbon transitions‚Äîincluding the multi-level perspective, Michel Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Anthony Giddens, Karl Marx, and other contextual approaches‚Äîbefore offering future research directions. The Review concludes that the power relations inherent in low-carbon transitions are asymmetrical but promisingly unstable. By better grappling with power analytically, descriptively, and even normatively, socially just and sustainable energy futures become not only more desirable but also more possible.},

	abstract = {Common-pool resource theory (CPR theory) emerged to understand the limitations of the tragedy of the commons narrative, and the theory of human behavior underlying it. Over time, diverse critiques of CPR theory have also emerged. Prominent critiques include inattention to power and coercion, assumptions that institutions can be crafted, and analyses that exclude history and context, among others. We label this literature critical commons scholarship. In this review paper, we define a typology of five types of critical commons scholarship. The functionalist critique (type 1) argues that a narrow focus on institutions that excludes history, context, and contingencies causes erroneous conclusions about the causes of resource sustainability. The apolitical management critique (type 2) argues that a focus on resource sustainability causes commons scholars to ignore how power is used to create and maintain inequalities through rules and norms structuring resource access. The methodological critique (type 3) argues that methodological incompatibilities, such as CPR theory‚Äôs dependence on general, abstract models, necessarily prevent these scholars from responding to type 1 and type 2 critiques. The project of government critique (type 4) argues that common-pool resource theory is used to support neoliberal and hegemonic practices. Finally, the ethical critique (type 5) argues that common-pool resource theory is premised on problematic north-south relationships where expert scholars in the global north provide information to be consumed by ‚Äúcommoners‚Äù in the global south. Mainstream CPR theory has been limited in engaging with critical commons scholarship, but there are new tools (such as the social-ecological systems framework and the critical institutionalism approach) for addressing each type of critique. Our goal in developing this typology is to make critiques of CPR theory legible and potentially actionable, while acknowledging the challenges associated with addressing them.},

	abstract = {Current theoretical models of the commons assert that common-pool resources can only be managed sustainably with clearly defined boundaries around both communities and the resources that they use. In these theoretical models, open access inevitably leads to a tragedy of the commons. However, in many open-access systems, use of common-pool resources seems to be sustainable over the long term (i.e., current resource use does not threaten use of common-pool resources for future generations). Here, we outline the conditions that support sustainable resource use in open property regimes. We use the conceptual framework of complex adaptive systems to explain how processes within and couplings between human and natural systems can lead to the emergence of efficient, equitable, and sustainable resource use. We illustrate these dynamics in eight case studies of different social‚Äìecological systems, including mobile pastoralism, marine and freshwater fisheries, swidden agriculture, and desert foraging. Our theoretical framework identifies eight conditions that are critical for the emergence of sustainable use of common-pool resources in open property regimes. In addition, we explain how changes in boundary conditions may push open property regimes to either common property regimes or a tragedy of the commons. Our theoretical model of emergent sustainability helps us to understand the diversity and dynamics of property regimes across a wide range of social‚Äìecological systems and explains the enigma of open access without a tragedy. We recommend that policy interventions in such self-organizing systems should focus on managing the conditions that are critical for the emergence and persistence of sustainability.},

The second is the increase of studies examining how REDD+ can contribute to the goals of CFM, and vice versa. The key methodological trend is the use of secondary data sets to determine outcomes of CFM policies at regional and national scales. These three trends add new perspectives to the debate on the effectiveness of CFM as a forest policy and institutional intervention.},

Assessing the prospects for effective joint action on climate change requires an understanding of both the structure of the climate change problem and national preferences for policy action. Preferences have become clearer in light of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties in December 2015. Although deep cooperation remains elusive, many partial efforts could build confidence and lead to larger cuts in emissions. This strategy of decentralized policy coordination will not solve the climate problem, but it could lead incrementally to deeper cooperation.},

	abstract = {Despite the recognition that institutions matter for international development, the debates over institutional reforms tend to obscure the role of power. Neoliberal models of development are often promoted in terms of their technical merits and efficiency gains and rarely account for the multiple ways that social, economic and political power shape institutional design and institutional change. Even recent efforts to address power tend to conceptualize it too narrowly. This special issue seeks to rethink the role of power in institutional creation and change in the context of persistent neoliberalism. In the introduction, we synthesize the literature on the nature of power to develop a new conceptual framework ‚Äì a power in institutions matrix ‚Äì that highlights the multiple dimensions of power involved in institutional development and change. We argue that such a theoretically-informed mapping of power in institutions will enable scholars, practitioners, and citizen groups to go beyond the standard critiques in order to analyze the multifaceted effects of neoliberal institutional change. Our introduction draws on an extensive literature review as well as the special issue contributors who examine institutional change in a variety of policy sectors in Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and North America. We find that a range of diverse local, national and transnational actors, with disparate access to power, negotiate institutional changes from above and below through overt imposition of and resistance to new rules, influence of agendas, and promotion of discourses. Neoliberalism thus creates a new distributive politics. The special issue thus offers a theoretically-grounded approach for linking international and domestic power differences to the process of institutional change, with a specific focus on equity and sustainability. In a departure from the current literature‚Äôs focus on elite bargains, we showcase the efforts by less powerful groups to gain a foothold in decision-making processes.},

Such partnerships have become mainstream implementation mechanisms for attaining international sustainable development goals and are also frequently used in other adjacent policy domains such as climate change, health and biodiversity. While multistakeholder arrangements are widely perceived as a positive contribution to addressing global change, few studies have systematically evaluated the existing evidence for their positive performance. This poses an urgent and important challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand and improve the effectiveness of partnerships, in particular since their popularity increases despite their past track record. The recommendations presented are based on own research, a literature survey and discussions with a large number or international Civil Society Organizations at two occasions during 2014. This article proceeds as follows: first, we define multistakeholder partnerships, outline their rational and summarize available assessments on partnership success; second, we provide a set of concrete recommendations based on lessons-learned from over 10 years of scholarship; and third, we conclude with some reflections on the future of multistakeholder governance for sustainability.},

By presenting a new and original data set and by presenting original essays by renowned scholars, this book lays the foundation for what will become an increasingly important focus for both economic development and international relations as well as for their intersection. The volume contains four parts. The first introduces the core issues and concepts that are explored throughout the book as well as a new and original data set on RPGs. The second part further develops specific concepts important for understanding 21st-century RPGs: regional leadership, alliances, networks, and outcomes. The third examines how cooperation takes place worldwide for a range of important RPGs. Finally, the fourth part discusses how public goods are produced in specific regions, stressing that each region has a distinct context and that these contexts overlap in a decentered "multiplex" manner. Global economic cooperation will be different in the 21st century, and this volume will be of interest to students and scholars of global governance, economic development, international political economy, sustainable development, and comparative regionalism."--Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {As the world becomes increasingly globalized, the need for governments to continually cooperate structures has become irreversible. This book looks critically at global governance structures in the economic and social field in order to understand what has been done and what can be done better. A close look at the United Nations (UN)‚Äôs relationship with development cooperation and global public goods, as well as its infrastructure and potential biases, gives a thorough understanding of the current status of the world‚Äôs premier global governance structure. Additionally, analyses of official development assistance, multilateral development banks, and infrastructure financing cast a wider net to demonstrate the growing need for global cooperation and development beyond the borders of the UN. These seven chapters by nearly a dozen authors have been written at a pivotal moment in global governance initiatives, when the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda is drawing international development into a new era. As this new agenda shifts the future of global development initiatives and increasingly relies on civil society, non-state actors, and regional and local governments to fulfill the sustainable development goals, how will international cooperation and development institutions be changed? And how can we make sure that these initiatives and institutions are innovating for the better?

	abstract = {This chapter aims to address this gap through an inductive, data-driven approach to analyzing RPGs. We present an original data set, based on the UN Treaty Collection series, which allows us to systematically measure a particular mode of RPG provision: cooperation among national governments to produce RPGs. In defining such cooperation, we exclude ODA;3 while ODA can also promote RPGs, we are interested here (for reasons later explained) in the efforts of states to provide RPGs through cooperative arrangements rather than the provision of bilateral or multilateral aid.
This approach enables us to map the existing ecosystem of RPG cooperation and observe patterns across space, time, and types of public goods. Through this exercise, we can gain empirical traction on the core conceptual questions that befuddle discussions of RPGs: what are the relevant boundaries of ‚Äúregions‚Äù? How do these differ for different public goods? Which public goods should be properly thought of as ‚Äúregional‚Äù?
These questions are not merely of academic interest. RPGs are increasingly important to the prospects of developing economies, but the conceptual and empirical challenges previously discussed prevent us from drawing systematic conclusions about their effectiveness. While this data set does not measure the coverage, quality, or impact of actual public goods provision, knowing which groups of countries are cooperating to produce which public goods is an important step toward doing so.},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a resurgence in innovation awards, in particular of grand innovation prizes (GIPs) which are rewards to innovators developing technologies reaching performance goals and requiring breakthrough solutions. GIPs typically do not preclude the winner also obtaining patent rights. This is in stark contrast with mainstream economics of innovation theories where prizes and patents are substitute ways to generate revenue and encourage innovation. Building on the management of innovation literature which stresses the difficulty to specify ex-ante all the technical features of the winning technologies, we develop a model in which innovative effort is multi-dimensional and only a subset of innovation tasks can be measured and contracted upon. We show that in this environment patent rights and cash rewards are complements, and that GIPs are often preferable to patent races or prizes requiring technologies to be placed in the public domain. Moreover, our model uncovers a tendency for patent races to encourage speed of discovery over quality of innovation, which can be corrected by GIPs. We explore robustness to endogenous entry, costly public funds, and incomplete information by GIP organizers on the surplus created by the technology.},

We draw the lessons from both practical experience in diverse contexts around the world and from scholarly advances in understanding the relationships between science and society. Many of these lessons will be familiar to those with experience in crafting knowledge to support action for sustainable development. However, few are included in the formal training of researchers. As a result, when scientists and engineers first venture out of the laboratory or library with the goal of linking their knowledge with action, the outcome has often been ineffectiveness and disillusionment. We therefore articulate here a core set of lessons that we believe should become part of the basic training for researchers interested in crafting usable knowledge for sustainable development. These lessons entail at least four things researchers should know, and four things they should do. The knowing lessons involve understanding the coproduction relationships through which knowledge making and decision making shape one another in social‚Äìenvironmental systems. We highlight the lessons that emerge from examining those coproduction relationships through the ICAP lens, viewing them from the perspectives of Innovation systems, Complex systems, Adaptive systems, and Political systems. The doing lessons involve improving the capacity of the research community to put its understanding of coproduction into practice. We highlight steps through which researchers can help build capacities for stakeholder collaboration, social learning, knowledge governance, and researcher training.},

	abstract = {The exercise of power permeates global governance processes, making power a critical concept for understanding, explaining, and influencing the intersection of global governance and health. This article briefly presents and discusses three well-established conceptualizations of power‚ÄîDahl‚Äôs, Bourdieu‚Äôs, and Barnett and Duvall‚Äôs‚Äîfrom different disciplines, finding that each is important for understanding global governance but none is sufficient. The conceptualization of power itself needs to be expanded to include the multiple ways in which one actor can influence the thinking or actions of others. I further argue that global governance processes exhibit features of complex adaptive systems, the analysis of which requires taking into account multiple types of power. Building on established frameworks, the article then offers an expanded typology of eight kinds of power: physical, economic, structural, institutional, moral, discursive, expert, and network. The typology is derived from and illustrated by examples from global health, but may be applicable to global governance more broadly. Finally, one seemingly contradictory ‚Äì and cautiously optimistic ‚Äì conclusion emerges from this typology: multiple types of power can mutually reinforce tremendous power disparities in global health; but at the same time, such disparities are not necessarily absolute or immutable. Further research on the complex interaction of multiple types of power is needed for a better understanding of global governance and health.},

	abstract = {Tackling major environmental change issues requires effective partnerships between science and governance, but relatively little work in this area has examined the diversity of settings from which such partnerships may, or may not, emerge. In this special feature we draw on experiences from around the world to demonstrate and investigate the consequences of diverse capacities and capabilities in bringing science and governance together. We propose the concept of coproductive capacities as a useful new lens through which to examine these relations. Coproductive capacity is the combination of scientific resources and governance capability that shapes the extent to which a society, at various levels, can operationalize relationships between scientific and public, private, and civil society institutions and actors to effect scientifically-informed social change. This recasts the relationships between science and society from notions of gaps to notions of interconnectedness and interplay (coproduction); alongside the societal foundations that shape what is or is not possible in that dynamic connection (capacities). The articles in this special feature apply this concept to reveal social, political, and institutional conditions that both support and inhibit high-quality environmental governance as global issues are tackled in particular places. Across these articles we suggest that five themes emerge as important to understanding coproductive capacity: history, experience, and perceptions; quality of relationships (especially in suboptimal settings); disjunct across scales; power, interests, and legitimacy; and alternative pathways for environmental governance. Taking a coproductive capacities perspective can help us identify which interventions may best enable scientifically informed, but locally sensitive approaches to environmental governance.},

For decades, scientists have been raising calls for societal changes that will reduce our impacts on nature. Though much conservation has occurred, our natural environment continues to decline under the weight of our consumption. Humanity depends directly on the output of nature; thus, this decline will affect us, just as it does the other species with which we share this world. D√≠az et al. review the findings of the largest assessment of the state of nature conducted as of yet. They report that the state of nature, and the state of the equitable distribution of nature's support, is in serious decline. Only immediate transformation of global business-as-usual economies and operations will sustain nature as we know it, and us, into the future.
Science, this issue p. eaax3100
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDHuman actions have long been known to drive declines in nature, and there is growing awareness of how globalization means that these drivers increasingly act at a distance (telecoupling). However, evidence from different disciplines has largely accumulated in parallel, and the global effects of telecouplings have never been addressed comprehensively. Now, the first integrated global-scale intergovernmental assessment of the status, trends, and future of the links between people and nature provides an unprecedented picture of the extent of our mutual dependence, the breadth and depth of the ongoing and impending crisis, and the interconnectedness among sectors and regions.
ADVANCESHuman impacts on life on Earth have increased sharply since the 1970s. The world is increasingly managed to maximize the flow of material contributions from nature to keep up with rising demands for food, energy, timber, and more, with global trade increasing the geographic separation between supply and demand. This unparalleled appropriation of nature is causing the fabric of life on which humanity depends to fray and unravel: Most indicators of the state of nature, whether monitored by natural and social scientists or by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are declining. These include the number and population size of wild species, the number of local varieties of domesticated species, the distinctness of ecological communities, and the extent and integrity of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. As a consequence, nature‚Äôs capacity to provide crucial benefits has also declined, including environmental processes underpinning human health and nonmaterial contributions to human quality of life. The costs are distributed unequally, as are the benefits of an expanding global economy.These trends in nature and its contributions to people are projected to worsen in the coming decades‚Äîunevenly so among different regions‚Äîunless rapid and integrated action is taken to reduce the direct drivers responsible for most change over the past 50 years: land and sea use change, direct harvesting of many plants and animals, climate change (whose impacts are set to accelerate), pollution, and the spread of invasive alien species. Exploratory scenarios suggest that a world with increased regional barriers‚Äîresonating with recent geopolitical trends‚Äîwill yield more negative global trends in nature, as well as the greatest disparity in trends across regions, greater than a world with liberal financial markets, and much greater than one that prioritizes and integrates actions toward sustainable development. Evidence from target-seeking scenarios and pathways indicates that a world that achieves many of the global biodiversity targets and sustainability goals related to food, energy, climate, and water is not‚Äîyet‚Äîbeyond reach, but that no single action can get us there.
OUTLOOKOur comprehensive assessment of status, trends, and possible futures for nature and people suggests that action at the level of direct drivers of nature decline, although necessary, is not sufficient to prevent further deterioration of the fabric of life on Earth. Reversal of recent declines‚Äîand a sustainable global future‚Äîare only possible with urgent transformative change that tackles the root causes: the interconnected economic, sociocultural, demographic, political, institutional, and technological indirect drivers behind the direct drivers. As well as a pan-sectoral approach to conserving and restoring the nature that underpins many goals, this transformation will need innovative governance approaches that are adaptive; inclusive; informed by existing and new evidence; and integrative across systems, jurisdictions, and tools. Although the challenge is formidable, every delay will make the task even harder. Crucially, our analysis pinpoints five priority interventions (‚Äúlevers‚Äù) and eight leverage points for intervention in the indirect drivers of global social and economic systems where they can make the biggest difference. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/sci/366/6471/eaax3100/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Traditional diversity-rich human landscapes, and the livelihoods and identities that depend on them, face global threats.Mosaics of crops, forest, and pasture have been maintained for millennia around the world. Now, they are under increasing threat from climate change and large-scale land use change to accommodate global demands for commodities. So are the livelihoods and cultural identity of the peoples that live in them, such as this woman collecting fodder for her flock in the Checacupe district, Per√∫.Photo credit www.estebantapella.com
The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s, driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature‚Äôs benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend‚Äînature and its contributions to people‚Äîis unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic, social, and technological causes of nature‚Äôs deterioration.},

Communicating Science Effectively: A Research Agenda [National Research Council (2017)] surveys the scientific foundations for accomplishing these tasks, the research agenda for improving them, and the essential collaborative relations with decision makers and communication professionals. Recognizing the complexity of the science, the decisions, and the communication processes, the report calls for a systems approach. This perspective offers an approach to creating such systems by adapting scientific methods to the practical constraints of science communication. It considers staffing (are the right people involved?), internal collaboration (are they talking to one another?), and external collaboration (are they talking to other stakeholders?). It focuses on contexts where the goal of science communication is helping people to make autonomous choices rather than promoting specific behaviors (e.g., voter turnout, vaccination rates, energy consumption). The approach is illustrated with research in two domains: decisions about preventing sexual assault and responding to pandemic disease.},

‚ÄúScience Advice and Global Environmental Governance‚Äù examines expert committees established to provide science advice to multilateral environmental agreements. By focusing on how these institutions are sites of coproduction of knowledge and policy, this work brings to light the politics of science advice and details how these committees are contributing to an emerging global environmental constitutionalism.
Grounded in participant observation, elite interviews and document analysis, ‚ÄúScience Advice and Global Environmental Governance‚Äù uses the lenses of the body of experts, body of knowledge, and institutional body to focus on three features of design. Who are the experts being asked to provide advice? What types of knowledge are considered beyond the bounds of the committee and how is this determined? What rules and norms are developed to govern how the committee carries out its work?
The empirical chapters lay out three illustrations: controversy over the continued use of methyl bromide despite it being scheduled for a ban under the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, a series of votes by the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Review Committee when determining whether the pesticide endosulfan should be banned under the Stockholm Convention on POPs and a decade of institutional innovation in an effort to revamp the provision of science advice to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.}

	abstract = {This report is an independent scientific review of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) and 169 targets, as submitted to the UN General Assembly by the UN Open Working Group (OWG). It is a unique tool designed primarily for negotiators, technical support
teams and other actors engaged in defining a universal, integrated and transformational
set of global goals and targets for sustainable development and the political declaration
on the post-2015 development Agenda. In particular it is a resource for technical review
of the targets carried out in preparation for their adoption and translation at the national
level. With more than 40 contributing authors from 21 countries, the report brings
together a wide range of scientific expertise across the natural and social sciences in an
accessible and concise manner.
The report offers rigorous analysis of the proposed goals and targets, collectively and
individually, assessing whether they are backed up by scientific evidence, whether they
address the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development
in an integrated way, and whether they are sufficiently specific to be effectively implemented and monitored.  It clearly identifies how well defined each target is through a
‚Äútraffic light‚Äù colour scheme (green, amber, red), signaling where more technical work
may be needed. Concrete recommendations are put forward for consideration in refining
the goals and targets or in planning for their implementation.

This report by the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Social Science Council (ISSC) finds that of the 169 targets beneath the 17 draft goals, just 29\% are well defined and based on the latest scientific evidence, while 54\% need more work and 17\% are weak or non-essential.},

Yet authoritarian political formations often undermine such participation through violent repression of dissent. This article seeks to advance understandings of violence against environmental and community activists challenging authoritarian forms of environmental and resource governance through eco-populist struggles. Authoritarianism and populism entertain complex relationships, including authoritarian practices toward and within eco-populist movements. Examining a major agrarian conflict and the killing of a prominent Indigenous leader in Honduras, we point to the frequent occurrence of deadly repression within societies experiencing high levels of inequalities, historical marginalization of Indigenous and peasant communities, a liberalization of foreign and private investments in land-based sectors, and recent reversals in partial democratization processes taking place within a broader context of high homicidal violence and impunity rates. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of deadly repression on environmental and land defenders. Key words: authoritarianism, environmental defenders, Honduras, populism, repression.},

Goal 4 promotes quality education and Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However, creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require individuals to acquire ‚Äòkey competencies‚Äô, aligning with notions of transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context specific competencies.},

The Bachelor of Arts in Sustainability Studies program at Colorado Mountain College serves as an example of how the articulated competency framework is being applied to evaluate and enhance curriculum and learning outcomes.

	abstract = {Mobilizations occurring around just transitions and design for transition contain many potential points of overlap. They are presently remarkably disengaged. This article seeks to rectify this situation by offering some preliminary notes on how convergences between these currents might facilitate modes of anti-racist, feminist and ecosocialist design futuring that can get us to think beyond degrowth/Left ecomodern binaries and toward a design politics that can support a Green New Deal. I proceed by mapping the evolution of labor-focused just transition discussions and indicate how feminist, climate justice and decolonial contributions have expanded and complicated understandings of the labors of transition. I then go on to suggest how such currents could productively engage further with the emerging field of design for transition. Design is not to be trusted. However, post-carbon futures are not simply going to emerge through protest and policy shifts alone. Just transitions will have to be imagined and built, fabricated and realized, coded and created. This will involve the channeling of enormous amounts of creative labor and inventive praxis. It will also involve the construction of public spaces and public institutions where new knowledge practices can meet. Bringing radical traditions of design, invention and innovation into dialogue with movements pushing for just transitions could make significant contributions to achieving this end.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the socio-technical transition literature, particularly the Multi-Level Perspective, which investigates the fundamental changes in (energy, transport, housing, agro-food) systems that are needed to address persistent sustainability problems. The article positions the MLP within the wider academic debate on sustainability transformations, and reviews criticisms and seven recent elaborations of the MLP with regard to: (1) politics and power, (2) cultural discourse and framing struggles, (3) grassroots innovation, (4) multiple transition pathways, (5) incumbent firm resistance and reorientation, (6) destabilization and decline, (7) policy analysis. Mobilizing insights from the wider social sciences, these elaborations have nuanced and differentiated the understanding of socio-technical transitions to sustainability and made the MLP the central pillar of a multi-facetted, cumulative research programme with a broad empirical evidence base.},

We theorize circumstances under which firms are less likely to engage in such selective disclosure, focusing on organizational and institutional factors that intensify scrutiny and expectations of transparency and that foster civil society mobilization. We test our hypotheses using a novel panel data set of 4,750 public companies across many industries that are headquartered in 45 countries during 2004‚Äì2007. Results show that firms that are more environmentally damaging, particularly those in countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and global norms, are less likely to engage in selective disclosure.

Yet, the most common drivers were awareness, education, and knowledge sharing; and (d) regardless of whether state-centric or decentralized governance was preferred, personal action was seen as essential. The focus groups displayed a shared understanding across the geographical settings; a common realization of profound sustainability predicaments facing societies across the world; and a desire for fundamental change towards a more sustainable way of life.},

The Global Chemicals Outlook II ‚Äì From Legacies to Innovative Solutions: Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, mandated by the UN Environment Assembly in 2016, seeks to alert policymakers and other stakeholders to the critical role of the sound management of chemicals and waste in sustainable development. It takes stock of global trends as well as progress made and gaps in achieving the global goal to minimize the adverse impacts from chemicals and waste by 2020.



The full¬†Global Chemicals Outlook II¬†was¬†launched electronically on 29 April 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, at a side event at the meetings of the conferences of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions. The Synthesis Report was launched on 11 March 2019 at the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly. A shorter Summary for Policymakers was tabled as working document of the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly and is available in all six UN languages.

The Global Chemicals Outlook II finds that the global goal to minimize adverse impacts of chemicals and waste will not be achieved by 2020. Solutions exist, but more ambitious worldwide action by all stakeholders is urgently required.

The Global Chemicals Outlook II consists of the following parts:


	Introduction and key messages for policymakers
	Part I:¬†The evolving chemicals economy: status and trends relevant for sustainability
	Part II: Where do we stand in achieving the 2020 goal ‚Äì assessing overall progress and gaps
	Part¬†III. Advancing and Sharing Chemicals Management Tools and Approaches: Taking Stock, Looking into the Future
	Part IV:¬†Enabling policies and action to support innovative solutions
	Part V:¬†Scaling up collaborative action under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
	Index


Process and mandate for the Global Chemicals Outlook II

The Global Chemicals Outlook II has been prepared over the past three years through a process involving more than 400 scientists and experts around the world under the guidance of the Steering Committee of the Global Chemicals Outlook II with participation from all regions and a wide range of stakeholders. The report has been developed in response to Governing Council decision 27/12, adopted in 2013, and United Nations Environment Assembly resolution 2/7, adopted in 2016.

The first edition of the Global Chemicals Outlook

The Global Chemicals Outlook: Towards Sound Management of Chemicals was published in February 2013 and assembled scientific, technical and socio-economic information on the sound management of chemicals.

It covered trends and indicators for chemical production, transport, use and disposal, and associated health and environmental impacts; economic implications of these trends, including costs of inaction and benefits of action; and instruments and approaches for sound management of chemicals. Decision 27/12, adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme in 2013, recognized the significance of the findings of the Global Chemicals Outlook.

Still, a Great Transition to a planetary civilization of enriched lives and a healthy planet remains possible. But how? What forms of collective action and consciousness can redirect us toward such a future? Who will lead the charge? What might such a world look like?

Journey to Earthland offers answers. It clarifies the world-historical challenge; explains the critical role of a global citizens movement in advancing social transformation; and paints a picture of the kind of flourishing civilization that might lie on the other side of a Great Transition.

In this pivotal moment, the odyssey to a different world is underway yet the ultimate destination depends on choices and struggles yet to come. Acting to prevent the futures we dread is where our work must begin. But the larger task is to foster the finer Earthland we and our descendants deserve.},

	abstract = {Citizen participation in decision-making has been widely lauded as a method for improving outcomes in
environmental management, international development, democratic governance, and sustainability
science, among other areas. While there are normative reasons to encourage more inclusive decisionmaking processes, costly and time-intensive group decision-making processes are often justified on the
grounds that they may also improve outcomes. Deliberative discussion, in particular, is believed to be
more transformative than a mere aggregation of individual preferences. Empirical work confirms that
deliberation results in shifts of opinion, but it has had little to say about the quality of the resulting
decisions, which are understandably difficult to assess in a field setting. This research involves controlled
laboratory experiments conducted in Nairobi, and it examines the hypothesis that deliberative discussion
leads to better (more socially optimal) collective decision-making. I find that participation in group
decision-making involving deliberation (but not a simple majority vote) does result in more successful
collective outcomes. This effect is not achieved through greater effort exerted, but rather through better
strategic decision making that minimizes the costs associated with contributions. Deliberation is also
associated with changes in preferences, greater levels of agreement with decision outcomes, and greater
perceived fairness. This research sheds some light on the relationship between deliberative democracy and
collective decision making.},

We review the results of this renewed and far more nuanced research frontier, focusing in particular on the way demographic trends affect exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation to environmental change. New research has explained how migration systems interact with environmental challenges in individual decisions and in globally aggregate flows. Here we integrate analysis on demographic and environmental risks that often share a root cause in limited social freedoms and opportunities.

Because forest transitions can increase biodiversity and augment carbon sequestration, they appeal to policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss and climate change. What then can policymakers do to trigger forest transitions? The historical record over the last two centuries provides insights into the precipitating conditions. The early transitions often occurred passively, through the spontaneous regeneration of trees on abandoned agricultural lands. Later forest transitions occurred more frequently after large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred governments to take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped lands. To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with clearly articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover. These historical shifts in forest transitions reflect our growing appreciation of their utility for countering droughts, floods, land degradation, and climate change.},

Both surveys and tax data show that wealth inequality has increased dramatically since the 1980s, with a top 1\% wealth share of approximately 40\% in 2016 versus 25‚Äì30\% in the 1980s. Second, I discuss the fast-growing literature on wealth inequality across the world. Evidence points toward a rise in global wealth concentration: For China, Europe, and the United States combined, the top 1\% wealth share has increased from 28\% in 1980 to 33\% today, while the bottom 75\% share hovered around 10\%. Recent studies, however, may underestimate the level and rise of inequality, as financial globalization makes it increasingly hard to measure wealth at the top. I discuss how new data sources (leaks from financial institutions, tax amnesties, and macroeconomic statistics of tax havens) can be leveraged to better capture the wealth of the rich.},

We then turn to the potential causal mechanisms behind the observed correlations. Given its focus on causal econometric models, we argue that economics has a comparative advantage in evaluating these mechanisms. We consider (a) profit-maximizing decisions by firms, (b) Tiebout-like utility-maximizing decisions by households in the presence of income disparities, (c) Coasean negotiations between both sides, (d) political economy explanations and governmental failures, and (e) intergenerational transmission of poverty. Proper identification of the causal mechanisms underlying observed disproportionate exposures is critical to the design of effective policy to remedy them.},

	abstract = {Climate change is altering the productivity of natural resources with far-reaching implications for those who depend on them. Resource-dependent industries and communities need the capacity to adapt to a range of climate risks if they are to remain viable. In some instances, the scale and nature of the likely impacts means that transformations of function or structure will be required. Transformations represent a switch to a distinct new system where a different suite of factors become important in the design and implementation of response strategies. There is a critical gap in knowledge on understanding transformational capacity and its influences. On the basis of current knowledge on adaptive capacity we propose four foundations for measuring transformational capacity: (1)¬†how risks and uncertainty are managed, (2)¬†the extent of skills in planning, learning and reorganizing, (3)¬†the level of financial and psychological flexibility to undertake change and (4)¬†the willingness to undertake change. We test the influence of place attachment and occupational identity on transformational capacity using the Australian peanut industry, which is presently assessing significant structural change in response to predicted climatic changes. Survey data from 88\% of peanut farmers in Queensland show a strong negative correlation between transformational capacity and both place attachment and occupational attachment, suggesting that whilst these factors may be important positive influences on the capacity to adapt to incremental change, they act as barriers to transformational change.},

	abstract = {A growing scholarship on multistakeholder learning dialogues suggests the importance of closely managing learning processes to help stakeholders anticipate which policies are likely to be effective. Much less work has focused on how to manage effective transnational multistakeholder learning dialogues, many of which aim to help address critical global environmental and social problems such as climate change or biodiversity loss. They face three central challenges. First, they rarely shape policies and behaviors directly, but work to ‚Äònudge‚Äô or ‚Äòtip the scales‚Äô in domestic settings. Second, they run the risk of generating ‚Äòcompromise‚Äô approaches incapable of ameliorating the original problem definition for which the dialogue was created. Third, they run the risk of being overly influenced, or captured, by powerful interests whose rationale for participating is to shift problem definitions or narrow instrument choices to those innocuous to their organizational or individual interests. Drawing on policy learning scholarship, we identify a six-stage learning process for anticipating effectiveness designed to minimize these risks while simultaneously fostering innovative approaches for meaningful and longlasting problem solving: Problem definition assessments; Problem framing; Developing coalition membership; Causal framework development; Scoping exercises; Knowledge institutionalization. We also identify six management techniques within each process for engaging transnational dialogues around problem solving. We show that doing so almost always requires anticipating multiple-step causal pathways through which influence of transnational and/or international actors and institutions might occur.},

Three general principles ‚Äì responsibilities, capabilities (capacity), and needs (or rights) ‚Äì are frequently invoked and rarely disputed. Yet, parties‚Äô interpretations often diverge, reflecting conflicts of interests. To determine how much is at stake, we compare ‚Äì by means of a global integrated assessment model (GRACE) ‚Äì 15 legitimate interpretations of ‚Äòresponsibilities‚Äô and ‚Äòcapabilities‚Äô in terms of their implications for the mitigation obligations and costs of seven potentially pivotal actors. Most of these interpretations yield similar results for most actors. In a scenario where global emissions in 2030 are reduced by 20\% compared to a business-as-usual baseline, mitigation costs vary by less than 1\% of GDP for the United States, the European Union, Japan, India, and China. For Brazil and Russia, however, variance is much larger. Moreover, for all actors, mitigation costs rise steeply as ambition levels increase. Under such circumstances, searching for a single ‚Äòfairness-optimizing‚Äô formula is likely to fail. As negotiators explore systems of voluntary pledges, a more promising approach would conceive of fairness as a multidimensional construct and foster accommodation through mutual recognition of a limited range of legitimate norm interpretations.},

Investing in climate mitigation yields highly uncertain future benefits. Such uncertainty should also be taken into account in the selection of the discount rate, although the appropriate approach is highly controversial.},

Examining clean energy laws in Texas, Kansas, Arizona, and Ohio over a thirty-year time frame, Stokes argues that organized combat between advocate and opponent interest groups is central to explaining why states are not on track to address the climate crisis. She tells the political history of our energy institutions, explaining how fossil fuel companies and electric utilities have promoted climate denial and delay. Stokes further explains the limits of policy feedback theory, showing the ways that interest groups drive retrenchment through lobbying, public opinion, political parties and the courts. More than a history of renewable energy policy in modern America, Short Circuiting Policy offers a bold new argument about how the policy process works, and why seeming victories can turn into losses when the opposition has enough resources to roll back laws.},

This paper takes issue with this claim. Policy advice, it is argued, needs to be anchored in the accumulated research on the issue at hand, in this case, innovation. The paper therefore starts by distilling some important insights on innovation from the accumulated research on this topic and, with this in mind, considers various policy approaches that have been suggested for influencing innovation and sustainability transitions. Finally, the lessons for the development and implementation of transformative innovation policy are considered.

This leaves planners vulnerable to surprise if future conditions diverge from predictions. In this review, we describe contemporary approaches to decision support that address deep uncertainty about future external forcings, system responses, and stakeholder preferences for different outcomes. Many of these methods are motivated by climate change adaptation, infra-structure planning, or natural resources management, and they provide dramatic improvements in the robustness of management strategies. We outline various methods conceptually and describe how they have been applied in a range of landmark real-world planning studies.},

	abstract = {Growing concerns that contemporary patterns of economic development are unsustainable have given rise to an extensive empirical literature on population growth, consumption increases, and our growing use of nature's products and services. However, far less has been done to reach a theoretical understanding of the socio-ecological processes at work at the populationconsumption-environment nexus. In this Research Article, we highlight the ubiquity of externalities (which are the unaccounted for consequences for others, including future people) of decisions made by each of us on reproduction, consumption, and the use of our natural environment. Externalities, of which the "tragedy of the commons" remains the most widely discussed illustration, are a cause of inefficiency in the allocation of resources across space, time, and contingencies; in many situations, externalities accentuate inequity as well. Here, we identify and classify externalities in consumption and reproductive decisions and use of the natural environment so as to construct a unified theoretical framework for the study of data drawn from the nexus. We show that externalities at the nexus are not self-correcting in the marketplace. We also show that fundamental nonlinearities, built into several categories of externalities, amplify the socio-ecological processes operating at the nexus. Eliminating the externalities would, therefore, require urgent collective action at both local and global levels.},

	abstract = {The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) is a prominent framework to understand socio-technical transitions, but its micro-foundations have remained under-developed. The paper's first aim is therefore to develop the MLP's theoretical micro-foundations, which are rooted in Social Construction of Technology, evolutionary economics and neoinstitutional theory. The second aim is to further identify crossovers between these theories. To achieve these goals, the paper analytically reviews the three theories, focusing on: (1) the relevance of each theory for transitions and the MLP, (2) the theory's conceptualisation of agency, (3) criticisms of each theory and subsequent conceptual elaborations (which prepare the ground for potential crossovers between them). Mobilizing insights from the analytical reviews, the paper articulates a multi-dimensional model of agency, which also provides a relational and processual conceptualization of ongoing trajectories in which actors are embedded. Specific conceptual linking points between the three theories are identified, leading to an understanding of socio-technical transitions as evolutionary, interpretive and conflictual processes.},

	abstract = {Energy transitions face multiple barriers, lock-in, path dependencies and resistance to change which require strategic policy efforts to be overcome. In this regard, it has been increasingly recognised that a multiplicity of instruments ‚Äì or instrument mixes ‚Äì are needed to foster low-carbon transitions. In addition, over the past few years a broader conceptualization of policy mixes for sustainability transitions has emerged which we adopt in this special issue. Such a broader perspective not only examines the interaction of instruments, but also captures corresponding policy strategies with their long-term targets and pays greater attention to the associated policy processes. It also encompasses the analysis of overarching policy mix characteristics such as consistency, coherence or credibility, as well as policy design considerations. Furthermore, it embraces the analysis of actors and institutions involved in developing and implementing such policy mixes. To explicitly consider these further aspects of policy mixes, this special issue includes fifteen papers with different analytical perspectives drawing on a range of social science disciplines, such as environmental economics, innovation studies and policy sciences. It is our hope that the conceptual and empirical advances presented here will stimulate diverse future research and inform policy advice on policy mixes for energy transitions.},

	abstract = {Safely achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement requires a worldwide transformation to carbon-neutral societies within the next 30 y. Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth‚Äôs climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions (STIs) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements (STEs). STEs are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The STIs that could trigger the tipping of STE subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation (STE1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities (STE2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels (STE3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels (STE4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement (STE5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions (STE6, information feedbacks). Our research reveals important areas of focus for larger-scale empirical and modeling efforts to better understand the potentials of harnessing social tipping dynamics for climate change mitigation.},

We promote integrated approaches to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, through education, research, policy analysis, and global cooperation.

HISTORY
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) was set up in 2012 under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. SDSN mobilizes global scientific and technological expertise to promote practical solutions for sustainable development, including the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement. SDSN works closely with United Nations agencies, multilateral financing institutions, the private sector, and civil society.

SDSN is guided by a Leadership Council, which brings together global sustainable development leaders from all regions and all sectors, including civil society, public, and private sectors. The Leadership Council acts as the board of SDSN. Much of SDSN‚Äôs work is led by National or Regional SDSNs, which mobilize knowledge institutions around the SDGs. Our research \& policy work mobilizes experts from around the world on the technical challenges of implementing the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement. The SDG Academy leads the education work of the SDSN.

Until 2016, the SDSN Secretariat was hosted by the Earth Institute at Columbia University. Since July 2016, the SDSN Secretariat and the SDG Academy have been hosted by the SDSN Association, a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization. SDSN has offices in New York and Paris.},

Due to different economic conditions and socio-cultural factors, sustainable consumption and production requires a diverse focus in developing and developed economies. To date, few efforts have been made to systematically compare the status of sustainable consumption and production and its direction from the perspective of developing and developed economies. This paper provides a literature review of published articles in international scientific journals related to sustainable consumption and production between 1998 and 2018 inclusive. Three carefully designed questions are proposed and answered in this article, forming the basis for conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of the differences and challenges in sustainable consumption and production practices within developed and developing economies. The findings strongly suggest that countries in Europe hold international leadership in sustainable consumption and production practices. This finding, alongside others, is analyzed and discussed in greater detail in this paper, resulting in the articulation of gaps and future research opportunities in the current body of the literature.},

	abstract = {Circular Economy (CE) aims to overcome the take-make-dispose linear pattern of production and consumption, proposing a circular system in which the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy as long as possible. In recent years there has been a proliferation of scholars' publications on the topic. This study presents the results of a systematic literature review exploring the state-of-the-art of academic research on CE. The paper examines the CE body of literature with a systematic approach, to provide an exhaustive analysis of the phenomenon with rigorous and reproducible research criteria. The revisited material consists of 565 articles collected through the Web of Science and Scopus databases, and has been evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group literature into analytical categories. Starting from being a concept studied in connection with industrial ecology, CE has slowly acquired its independent role in academic research, framed mainly into environmental sustainability related studies. As a result of policies implementation, academic production is mainly concentrated in China and Europe, employing tools and methods for modelling processes and supporting decision-making for CE implementation (e.g. Life Cycle Assessment and Material Flow Analysis). CE studies follow three main lines of action: the first aims to change the social and economic dynamics at macro and administrative level; the second to support firms in circular processes implementation at micro level to spread new forms of consumption and product design; the third, developed at meso level, discusses industrial symbiosis experiences. CE is associated with a variety of concepts, and waste management emerges as the most relevant sub-sector. CE is also strongly connected with the concept of sustainability, proposing ways to operationalize its implementation at the environmental and economic level, while scholars only marginally consider social and institutional implications. The most explored practices are those related to cleaner production, aiming at reducing environmental impact and waste production along the life cycle of a product, and optimizing the performance and efficiency of processes. Conversely, studies on CE may devote greater attention to strategies for social and institutional changes, able to transform the upstream process of production and consumption. Considering business model strategies, scholars mainly focus on studying closing material loops strategy, while slowing the loops, which requires a radical change of consumption and production patterns, is only marginally included with respect to CE implementation. This study's findings highlight CE as an evolving concept that still requires development to consolidate its definition, boundaries, principles and associated practices.},

The first strategy of friendly critique accepts the basic assumptions of most writings on common property to show that scholars of commons have discovered far more variables that potentially affect resource management than is possible to analyze carefully. The paper identifies some potential means to address the problem of too many variables. The second line of critique proceeds differently. It asks how analyses of common property might change, and what they need to consider, if they loosen assumptions about sovereign selves and apolitical property rights institutions. My examination of these questions concludes this review with an emphasis on the need to (a) attend more carefully to processes of subject formation, and (b) investigate common property arrangements and associated subject positions with greater historical depth.},

Nowhere is this action-oriented research needed more than in urban areas that are now home to more than half of the world‚Äôs population, generating about 80\% of the world‚Äôs economy (3) as well as over 70\% of global energy use and global energy-related emissions (4). Depending on the literature and perspectives taken, urbanization and cities will be either key components to the transition to sustainability or major threats to sustainability. The dichotomy in views is partly a result of the wide range in urban conditions and uneven urbanization processes around the world. Urban areas can be sites of innovation and production of knowledge and wealth, and provide widespread access to employment, education, sanitation, and modern energy, but they can also have high levels of pollution, social exclusion, environmental degradation, and cause unintended consequences outside of the urban boundaries; all of these outcomes could occur simultaneously through the same urbanization process.

A number of urban transitions are underway, several of which involve: the change from a predominantly rural and lower-density population to an urban and higher-density living; the shift in economies from agrarian to manufacturing and services, finance, and technology; the increasing resource intensity of energy, materials, and water required to produce a unit of good or service; the lasting imprint and spatial configuration of built environments and their requisite infrastructures; the subtle impact on a broad spectrum of biotic interactions and the significant threats to biodiversity; the increasing complexity and reach of urban institutions and governance to enforce the rule of law and maintain civil society; and the transition from individually demarcated cities and towns to the ‚Ä¶

This paper addresses the question of whether and how social movements contribute to the organization and robustness of CBNRM in the advent of those threats. To accomplish this, we carry out a qualitative meta-analysis of 81 cases worldwide. Our evidence shows that one of the most important effects of movements on CBNRM is the promotion and defense of community use and management rights against certain government decisions or actions by global corporations. We also find that movements can generate positive effects beyond the reaction to specific threats. Those effects include the democratization of communities‚Äô collective choice processes, the reinvigoration of identity ties and local ecological knowledge, the promotion of economic development and autonomy, and the creation of nested user organizations. Exploring such potentially longer-term effects is a promising next step towards further connecting the social movement and CBNRM scholarships and better understanding the robustness of local management regimes in the context of global change.},

This Special Issue of Journal of Cleaner Production targets to collect the latest research results on sustainable energy systems, discover innovative avenues and inspiring models and share knowledge on energy system modelling and management. In this paper, we identify 4 themes on sustainable energy transition pathways including: (1) Sustainable energy economics and management; (2) Renewable energy generation and consumption; (3) Environmental impacts of energy systems; and (4) Electric vehicle and energy storage. Theories, technologies, innovative models, and successful experiences are discussed accordingly. It is suggested that creative, robust and audacious strategies in governance, management and education are needed to boost sustainable energy transition across various scales and sectors.},

	abstract = {Modularity limits disturbance effects
The networks that form natural, social, and technological systems are vulnerable to the spreading impacts of perturbations. Theory predicts that networks with a clustered or modular structure‚Äîwhere nodes within a module interact more frequently than they do with nodes in other modules‚Äîmight contain a perturbation, preventing it from spreading to the entire network. Gilarranz et al. conducted experiments with networked populations of springtail (Folsomia candida) microarthropods to show that modularity limits the impact of a local extinction on neighboring nodes (see the Perspective by Sales-Pardo). In networks with high modularity, the perturbation was contained within the targeted module, and its impact did not spread to nodes beyond it. However, simulations revealed that modularity is beneficial to the network only when perturbations are present; otherwise, it hinders population growth.
Science, this issue p. 199; see also p. 128
Networks with a modular structure are expected to have a lower risk of global failure. However, this theoretical result has remained untested until now. We used an experimental microarthropod metapopulation to test the effect of modularity on the response to perturbation. We perturbed one local population and measured the spread of the impact of this perturbation, both within and between modules. Our results show the buffering capacity of modular networks. To assess the generality of our findings, we then analyzed a dynamical model of our system. We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size. However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.
Networks of springtail (Folsomia candida) microarthropods are more robust to perturbation when organized in modules.

First, I analyze the circumstances in which distributional concerns make desirable a tax or regulation inducing significant reductions in carbon usage in a carbon-intensive sector for which consumers are disproportionately rich. Such policies allow lower carbon prices elsewhere without exceeding carbon emission targets. The cost of the resulting production inefficiency may, under the identified circumstances, be less than the distributional benefits. The paper considers the circumstances in which such differential policies may be best implemented through regulation vs. differential pricing, as well as differential effects on political economy and norm setting. Second, I consider the effect of carbon price trajectories on induced innovation, providing general conditions under which the optimal carbon path should, at least eventually, be falling over time. Finally, I revisit the price-versus-quantity debate and highlight important aspects of the dynamic nature of the problem.},

This is due to the fact that sustainable development is a pressing issue that requires immediate action and changes from governments, industry, and society as whole. This article reviews the literature on innovations that can lead to transformations in individuals, organizations, supply chains, and communities toward a sustainable future. Although many of the articles explored in this review report on existing urgent environmental and social issues, their findings, recommendations, and contributions are encouraging as we make progress toward a sustainable society through innovation and change. This article reviews the diversity of innovation for Sustainable Development in the literature, proposes a typology of such a phenomenon, provides an overview of key articles based on the primary subjects they address, and identifies a series of recommendations for the future development of the field.},

	abstract = {Current sustainability challenges ‚Äì including biodiversity loss, pollution and land-use change ‚Äì require new ways of understanding, acting in and caring for the landscapes we live in. The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a ‚Äòboundary object‚Äô; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts ‚Äì and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly ‚Äì this paper can act as a helpful ‚Äòcentering device‚Äô, connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.},

The methodology employed is a structural-strategic analysis within a political economy theoretical framework.

In this audacious follow-up, Piketty challenges us to revolutionize how we think about politics, ideology, and history. He exposes the ideas that have sustained inequality for the past millennium, reveals why the shallow politics of right and left are failing us today, and outlines the structure of a fairer economic system. Our economy, Piketty observes, is not a natural fact. Markets, profits, and capital are all historical constructs that depend on choices. Piketty explores the material and ideological interactions of conflicting social groups that have given us slavery, serfdom, colonialism, communism, and hypercapitalism, shaping the lives of billions. He concludes that the great driver of human progress over the centuries has been the struggle for equality and education and not, as often argued, the assertion of property rights or the pursuit of stability. The new era of extreme inequality that has derailed that progress since the 1980s, he shows, is partly a reaction against communism, but it is also the fruit of ignorance, intellectual specialization, and our drift toward the dead-end politics of identity. Once we understand this, we can begin to envision a more balanced approach to economics and politics. Piketty argues for a new "participatory" socialism, a system founded on an ideology of equality, social property, education, and the sharing of knowledge and power"--},

	abstract = {Social and institutional diversity (‚Äúdiversity‚Äù hereafter) are important dimensions in collaborative environmental governance, but lack empirical assessment. In this paper, we examine three aspects of diversity hypothesized in the literature as being important in collaborative forms of environmental governance‚Äîthe presence of diverse actors, diverse perspectives, and diverse institutions. The presence of these aspects and formative conjectures were empirically considered using a mixed methods approach in four biosphere reserves in Sweden and Canada. We found that the diversity of actors involved and domains of authority varied among cases, that stakeholder perspectives were highly diverse in all cases, and that institutional variety (in terms of strategies, norms, and rules) was evident in all cases, but differed among them. Empirical support from the cases further affirms that diversity contributes to the ability to engage with a broader set of issues and challenges; diversity contributes to novel approaches to solving problems within the governance group; and diversity contributes to the flexibility of the group involved in governance in terms of addressing challenges. One conjecture, that diversity decreases the efficiency of governance in decision-making and responding to issues, was not supported by the data. However, our analysis indicates that there might be a trade-off between diversity and efficiency. The findings highlight differences in the ways in which diversity is conceptualized in the literature and on the ground, emphasizing the pragmatic advantages of actively seeking diversity in terms of competencies and capacities.},

We test this argument with data from 350 forest user groups in 14 developing countries. Our results suggest that securing harvesting rights for local user groups can contribute to more equal benefit sharing, especially in ethnically homogenous groups.},

CDD devolves control over the selection, implementation, and financial management of public goods to communities. Until recently, policy enthusiasm has outstripped the evidence. I synthesize findings from randomized controlled trials and find that CDD effectively delivers public goods and modest economic returns at low cost in difficult environments. There is little evidence, however, that CDD transforms local decision making or empowers the poor in any enduring way. Part of this failure may be because some constraints believed to be important‚Äîlike insufficient social capital‚Äîappear not to bind. Others, like exclusive local institutions, are a problem, although not one that CDD remedies. These results present a conundrum: How much participation is enough to safeguard the gains of such extreme decentralization while minimizing the opportunity costs imposed on poor people's time?},

In an interconnected complex system, flexibility allows prompt deployment of resources where they are needed and is crucial for both innovation and robustness. A comparative analysis of flexible manufacturing systems, economics, evolutionary biology, and supply chain management is conducted to identify the most important characteristics of flexibility. Evolutionary biology emphasises overlapping functions and multi-functionality, which allow a system with structurally different elements to perform the same function, enhancing resilience. In economics, marginal cost and marginal expected profit are factors that are considered to be important in incorporating flexibility while making changes to the system. In flexible manufacturing systems, the size of choice sets is important in creating flexibility, as initial actions preserve more options for future actions that will enhance resilience. Given the dynamic nature of flexibility, identifying the characteristics that can lead to flexibility will introduce a crucial dimension to designing resilient and sustainable socio-ecological systems with a long-term perspective in mind.},

	abstract = {The Hunter Valley, in New South Wales, Australia, is a globally significant coal mining and exporting region. The Hunter economy's strong basis in fossil fuel production and consumption is challenged by civil society campaigns employing environmental justice discourses. This paper analyses how two civil society campaigns in the Hunter region (‚ÄòStop T4‚Ä≤ and 'Groundswell‚Äô) have countered the regional hegemony of fossil fuel interests from an environmental justice perspective. However, the discursive dominance of the 'jobs versus environment‚Äô frame hinders efforts to build solidarity amongst local environmental justice goals on the one hand, and workers and union aspirations for secure, quality jobs on the other. Long-term structural decline of global coal markets adds pressure for economic transition. We argue that campaigns to open up possibilities for transition away from fossil fuel dependency to a post-carbon society can be strengthened by engaging with the 'just transition‚Äô discourses that are typically associated with organised labour. Doing so can create synergy for social change by aligning community and labour movement interests. Inclusive social movement partnerships around this synergy must address structural disadvantage that creates social and economic insecurity if communities are to prevail over the fossil fuel sector's hegemony.},

	abstract = {Through their synergies, trade-offs, and contradictions, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have the potential to lead to environmental justices and injustices. Yet, environmental justice (EJ), and social justice more broadly, are not currently embedded within the language and spirit of the SDGs. We part from the premise that ‚Äúmany ‚Äòenvironmental‚Äô problems are, by their very nature, problems of justice‚Äù (Lele, Wiley Interdiscip Rev Water 4:e1224, 2017). We review progress in EJ frameworks in recent years, arguing for the need to move beyond a focus on the four principles of mainstream EJ (distribution, procedure, recognition, and capabilities) towards a more intersectional decolonial approach to environmental justice that recognises the indispensability of both humans and non-humans. EJ frameworks, and the SDGs should recognise power dynamics, complex interactions among injustices, and listens to the different ‚Äòsenses of justice‚Äô and desires of theorists, activists, and other stakeholder from the Global South. We analyze how EJ frameworks are, or fail to be, incorporated in the SDGs with a focus on the food‚Äìwater‚Äìhealth nexus (SDG2, 3, 6); climate-energy (SDG7, 13), conservation (SDG14, 15); and poverty and inequality (SDG1, 10). We call attention to the ‚Äòelephant in the room‚Äô‚Äîthe failure to go beyond GDP but instead include economic growth as a goal (SDG8). We argue that sustainable degrowth and intersectional decolonial environmental justices would create better conditions for the transformative changes needed to reach the broader aim of the SDGs: to leave no one behind.},

	abstract = {Creating a just and sustainable planet will require not only small changes, but also systemic transformations in how humans relate to the planet and to each other, i.e., social‚Äìecological transformations. We suggest there is a need for collaborative environments where experimentation with new configurations of social‚Äìecological systems can occur, and we refer to these as transformative spaces. In this paper, we seek a better understanding of how to design and enable the creation of transformative spaces in a development context. We analyse nine case studies from a previous special issue on Designing Transformative Spaces that aimed to collect examples of cutting-edge action-oriented research on transformations from the Global South. The analysis showed five design phases as being essential: Problem Definition Phase; Operationalisation Phase; Tactical Phase; Outcome Phase; and Reflection Phase. From this synthesis, we distilled five key messages that should be considered when designing research, including: (a) there are ethical dilemmas associated with creating a transformative space in a system; (b) it is important to assess the readiness of the system for change before engaging in it; (c) there is a need to balance between ‚Äòsafe‚Äô and ‚Äòsafe-enough‚Äô spaces for transformation; (d) convening a transformative space requires an assemblage of diverse methodological frameworks and tools; and (e) transformative spaces can act as a starting point for institutionalising transformative change. Many researchers are now engaging in transdisciplinary transformations research, and are finding themselves at the knowledge‚Äìaction interface contributing to transformative space-making. We hope that by analysing experiences from across different geographies we can contribute towards better understanding of how to navigate the processes needed for the urgent global transformations that are being called for to create a more equitable and sustainable planet Earth.},
